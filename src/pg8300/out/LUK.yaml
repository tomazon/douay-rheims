intro: St. Luke was a native of Antioch, the capital of Syria. He was by profession
  a physician; and some ancient writers say, that he was very skillful in painting.
  He was converted by St. Paul and became his disciple and companion in his travels,
  and fellow-labourer in the ministry of the Gospel. He wrote in Greek, about twenty-four
  years after our Lord's Ascension.
