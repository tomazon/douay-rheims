      raw: Aleph... The first eight verses of this psalm in the original begin with
        Aleph, which is the name of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The second
        eight verses begin with Beth, the name of the second letter of the Hebrew
        alphabet; and so to the end of the whole alphabet, in all twenty-two letters,
        each letter having eight verses. This order is variously expounded by the
        holy fathers; which shews the difficulty of understanding the holy scriptures,
        and consequently with what humility, and submission to the Church they are
        to be read.

      raw: 'A gradual canticle... The following psalms, in number fifteen, are called
        gradual psalms, or canticles, from the word gradus, signifying steps, ascensions,
        or degrees: either because they were appointed to be sung on the fifteen steps,
        by which the people ascended to the temple: or, that in the singing of them
        the voice was to be raised by certain steps or ascensions: or, that they were
        to be sung by the people returning from their captivity and ascending to Jerusalem,
        which was seated amongst mountains. The holy fathers, in a mystical sense,
        understand these steps, or ascensions, of the degrees by which Christians
        spiritually ascend to virtue and perfection; and to the true temple of God
        in the heavenly Jerusalem.'

intro: 'The psalms are called by the Hebrews TEHILLIM, that is, Hymns of Praise. The
  author, of a great part of them at least, was king David: but many are of opinion
  that some of them were made by Asaph, and others whose names are prefixed in the
  titles.'
