intro: In this Epistle St. Paul comforts those who are now reformed by his admonitions
  to them in the former and absolves the incestuous man on doing penance, whom he
  had before excommunicated for his crime. Hence he treats of true penance and of
  the dignity of the ministers of the New Testament. He cautions the faithful against
  false teachers and the society of infidels. He gives an account of his sufferings
  and also of the favours and graces which God hath bestowed on him. This second Epistle
  was written in the same year with the first and sent by Titus from some place in
  Macedonia.
