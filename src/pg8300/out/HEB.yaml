intro: 'St. Paul wrote this Epistle to the Christians in Palestine, the most part
  of whom being Jews before their conversion, they were called Hebrews. He exhorts
  them to be thoroughly converted and confirmed in the faith of Christ, clearly shewing
  them the preeminence of Christ''s priesthood above the Levitical, and also the excellence
  of the new law above the old. He commends faith by the example of the ancient fathers:
  and exhorts them to patience and perseverance and to remain in fraternal charity.
  &nbsp;It appears from chap. 13 that this Epistle was written in Italy, and probably
  at Rome, about twenty-nine years after our Lord''s Ascension.'
