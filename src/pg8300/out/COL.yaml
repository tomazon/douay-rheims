intro: Colossa was a city of Phrygia, near Laodicea. It does not appear that St. Paul
  had preached there himself, but that the Colossians were converted by Epaphras,
  a disciple of the Apostles. However, as St. Paul was the great Apostle of the Gentiles,
  he wrote this Epistle to the Colossians when he was in prison, and about the same
  time that he wrote to the Ephesians and Philippians. The exhortations and doctrine
  it contains are similar to that which is set forth in his Epistle to the Ephesians.
