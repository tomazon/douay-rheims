intro: 'This Book is called the Canticle of Canticles, that is to say, the most excellent
  of all canticles: because it is full of high mysteries, relating to the happy union
  of Christ and his spouse: which is here begun by love; and is to be eternal in heaven.
  The spouse of Christ is the church: more especially as to the happiest part of it,
  viz., perfect souls, every one of which is his beloved, but, above all others, the
  immaculate and ever blessed virgin mother.'
