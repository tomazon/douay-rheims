    intro:
      - He recommends walking in truth, loving one another and to beware of false
        teachers.
intro: The Apostle commends Electa and her family for their steadfastness in the true
  faith and exhorts them to persevere, lest they lose the reward of their labours.
  He exhorts them to love one another. But with heretics to have no society, even
  not to salute them. Although this Epistle is written to a particular person, yet
  its instructions may serve as a lesson to others, especially to those who, from
  their connections, situation, or condition in life, are in danger of perversion.
