intro: 'This Book is so called from a Greek word that signifies a preacher: because,
  like an excellent preacher, it gives admirable lessons of all virtues. The author
  was Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem, who flourished about two hundred years
  before Christ. As it was written after the time of Esdras, it is not in the Jewish
  canon; but is received as canonical and divine by the Catholic Church, instructed
  by apostolical tradition, and directed by the spirit of God. It was first written
  in the Hebrew, but afterwards translated into Greek, by another Jesus, the grandson
  of the author, whose prologue to this book is the following:'
long_title: ECCLESIASTICUS
prolog: 'The knowledge of many and great things hath been shewn us by the law, and
  the prophets, and others that have followed them: for which things Israel is to
  be commended for doctrine and wisdom, because not only they that speak must needs
  be skilful, but strangers also, both speaking and writing, may by their means become
  most learned. My grandfather Jesus, after he had much given himself to a diligent
  reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books, that were delivered to us
  from our fathers, had a mind also to write something himself, pertaining to doctrine
  and wisdom; that such as are desirous to learn, and are made knowing in these things,
  may be more and more attentive in mind, and be strengthened to live according to
  the law. I entreat you therefore to come with benevolence, and to read with attention,
  and to pardon us for those things wherein we may seem, while we follow the image
  of wisdom, to come short in the composition of words; for the Hebrew words have
  not the same force in them when translated into another tongue. And not only these,
  but the law also itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small
  difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtieth
  year coming into Egypt, when Ptolemy Evergetes was king, and continuing there a
  long time, I found there books left, of no small nor contemptible learning. Therefore
  I thought it good, and necessary for me to bestow some diligence and labour to interpret
  this book; and with much watching and study in some space of time, I brought the
  book to an end, and set it forth for the service of them that are willing to apply
  their mind, and to learn how they ought to conduct themselves, who purpose to lead
  their life according to the law of the Lord.'
