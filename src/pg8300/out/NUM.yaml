  of the people. The Hebrews, from its first words, call it VAIEDABBER. It contains
  the transactions of the Israelites from the second month of the second year after
  their going out of Egypt, until the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth
  year; that is, a history almost of thirty-nine years.
