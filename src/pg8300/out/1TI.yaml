intro: 'St. Paul write this Epistle to his BELOVED TIMOTHY, being then bishop of Ephesus,
  to instruct him in the duties of a bishop, both in respect to himself and to his
  charge; and that he ought to be well informed of the good morals of those on whom
  he was to impose hands: Impose not hands lightly upon any man. He tells him also
  how he should behave towards his clergy. The Epistle was written about 33 years
  after our Lord''s Ascension; but where it was written is uncertain: the more general
  opinion is, that it was in Macedonia.'
