intro: The first Epistle of St. Peter, though brief, contains much doctrine concerning
  Faith, Hope, and Charity, with divers instructions to all persons of what state
  or condition soever. &nbsp;The Apostle commands submission to rulers and superiors
  and exhorts all to the practice of a virtuous life in imitation, of Christ. This
  Epistle is written with such apostolical dignity as to manifest the supreme authority
  with which its writer, the Prince of the Apostles, had been vested by his Lord and
  Master, Jesus Christ. He wrote it at Rome, which figuratively he calls Babylon,
  about fifteen years after our Lord's Ascension.
