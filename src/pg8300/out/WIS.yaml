intro: This Book is so called, because it treats of the excellence of WISDOM, the
  means to obtain it, and the happy fruits it produces. It is written in the person
  of Solomon, and contains his sentiments. But it is uncertain who was the writer.
  It abounds with instructions and exhortations to kings and all magistrates to minister
  justice in the commonwealth, teaching all kinds of virtues under the general names
  of justice and wisdom. It contains also many prophecies of Christ's coming, passion,
  resurrection, and other Christian mysteries. The whole may be divided into three
  parts. In the first six chapters, the author admonishes all superiors to love and
  exercise justice and wisdom. In the next three, he teacheth that wisdom proceedeth
  only from God, and is procured by prayer and a good life. In the other ten chapters,
  he sheweth the excellent effects and utility of wisdom and justice.
