intro: 'This inspired writer is called by the Holy Ghost, the great prophet, (Ecclesiasticus:48.25,)
  from the greatness of his prophetic spirit, by which he hath foretold so long before,
  and in so clear a manner, the coming of Christ, the mysteries of our redemption,
  the calling of the Gentiles, and the glorious establishment, and perpetual flourishing
  of the church of Christ: insomuch that he may seem to have been rather an evangelist
  than a prophet. His very name is not without mystery; for Isaias in Hebrew signifies
  the salvation of the Lord, or Jesus is the Lord. He was, according to the tradition
  of the Hebrews, of the blood royal of the kings of Juda: and after a most holy life,
  ended his days by a glorious martyrdom; being sawed in two, at the command of his
  wicked son in law, King Manasses, for reproving his evil ways.'
