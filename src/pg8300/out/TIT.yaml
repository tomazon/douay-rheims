intro: St. Paul, having preached the faith in the island of Crete, he ordained his
  beloved disciple and companion, Titus, bishop, and left him there to finish the
  work which he had begun. Afterwards the Apostle, on a journey to Nicopolis, a city
  of Macedonia, wrote this Epistle to Titus, in which he directs him to ordain bishops
  and priests for the different cities, shewing him the principal qualities necessary
  for a bishop. He also gives him particular advice for his own conduct to his flock,
  exhorting him to hold to strictness of discipline, but seasoned with lenity. It
  was written about thirty-three years after our Lord's Ascension.
