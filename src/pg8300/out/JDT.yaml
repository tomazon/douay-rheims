intro: The sacred writer of this Book is generally believed to be the high priest
  Eliachim (called also Joachim). The transactions herein related, most probably happened
  in his days, and in the reign of Manasses, after his repentance and return from
  captivity. It takes its name from that illustrious woman, by whose virtue and fortitude,
  and armed with prayer, the children of Israel were preserved from the destruction
  threatened them by Holofernes and his great army. It finishes with her canticle
  of thanksgiving to God.
