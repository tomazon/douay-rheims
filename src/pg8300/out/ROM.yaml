intro: St. Paul wrote this epistle at Corinth, when he was preparing to go to Jerusalem
  with the charitable contributions collected in Achaia and Macedonia for the relief
  of the Christians in Judea; which was about twenty-four years after Our Lord's Ascension.
  It was written in Greek; but at the same time translated into Latin, for the benefit
  of those who did not understand that language. &nbsp;And though it is not the first
  of his Epistles in the order of time, yet it is first placed on account of sublimity
  of the matter contained in it, of the preeminence of the place to which it was sent,
  and in veneration of the Church.
