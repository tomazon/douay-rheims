intro: 'AGGEUS was one of those that returned from the captivity of Babylon, in the
  first year of the reign of king Cyrus. He was sent by the Lord, in the second year
  of the reign of king Darius, the son of Hystaspes, to exhort Zorobabel the prince
  of Juda, and Jesus the high priest, to the building of the temple; which they had
  begun, but left off again through the opposition of the Samaritans. In consequence
  of this exhortation they proceeded in the building and finished the temple. And
  the prophet was commissioned by the Lord to assure them that this second temple
  should be more glorious than the former, because the Messiah should honour it with
  his presence: signifying withal how much the church of the New Testament should
  excel that of the Old Testament.'
