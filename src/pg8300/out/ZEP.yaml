intro: SOPHONIAS, whose name, saith St. Jerome, signifies The Watchman of the Lord,
  or The hidden of the Lord, prophesied in the beginning of the reign of Josias. He
  was a native of Sarabatha, and of the tribe of Simeon, according to the more general
  opinion. He prophesied the punishments of the Jews, for their idolatry and other
  crimes; also the punishments that were to come on divers nations; the coming of
  Christ, the conversion of the Gentiles, the blindness of the Jews, and their conversion
  towards the end of the world.
