intro: The Galatians, soon after St. Paul had preached the Gospel to them, were seduced
  by some false teachers, who had been Jews and who were for obliging all Christians,
  even those who had been Gentiles, to observe circumcision and the other ceremonies
  of the Mosaical law. In this Epistle, he refutes the pernicious doctrine of those
  teachers and also their calumny against his mission and apostleship. The subject
  matter of this Epistle is much the same as that to the Romans. It was written at
  Ephesus, about twenty-three years after our Lord's Ascension.
