intro: 'This second book of MACHABEES is not a continuation of the history contained
  in the first: nor does is come down so low as the first does: but relates many of
  the same facts more at large, and adds other remarkable particulars, omitted in
  the first book, relating to the state of the Jews, as well before as under the persecution
  of ANTIOCHUS. The author, who is not the same with that of the first book, has given
  (as we learn from chap. 2.20, etc.) a short abstract of what JASON of Cyrene had
  written in the five volumes, concerning JUDAS and his brethren. He wrote in Greek,
  and begins with two letters, sent by the Jews of Jerusalem to their brethren in
  Egypt.'
