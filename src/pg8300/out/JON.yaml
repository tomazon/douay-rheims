    chapter_title: Jonas Chapter 4
intro: 'JONAS prophesied in the reign of JEREBOAM the second: as we learn from 4 Kings
  14.25. To whom also he foretold his success in restoring all the borders of Israel.
  He was of GETH OPHER in the tribe of ZABULON, and consequently of GALILEE: which
  confutes that assertion of the Pharisees, John 7.52, that no prophet ever rose out
  of GALILEE. He prophesied and prefigured in his own person the death and resurrection
  of CHRIST: and was the only one among the prophets that was sent to preach to the
  Gentiles.'
