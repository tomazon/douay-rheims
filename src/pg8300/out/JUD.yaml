    intro:
      - He exhorts them to stand to the faith first delivered to them and to beware
        of heretics.
intro: 'St. Jude, who wrote this Epistle, was one of the twelve Apostles and brother
  to St. James the Less. The time it was written is uncertain: only it may be inferred
  from verse 17 that few or none of the Apostles were then living, except St. John.
  He inveighs against the heresies and wicked practices of the Simonians, Nicolaites,
  and Gnostics, etc., describing them and their leaders by strong epithets and similes,
  He exhorts the faithful to contend earnestly for the faith first delivered to them
  and to beware of heretics.'
