        also the case of the history of Bel and the Dragon. But both the one and the
        other are received by the Catholic Church: and were from the very beginning
        a part of the Christian Bible.'

intro: 'DANIEL, whose name signifies THE JUDGMENT OF GOD, was of the royal blood of
  the kings of Juda: and one of those that were first of all carried away into captivity.
  He was so renowned for wisdom and knowledge, that it became a proverb among the
  Babylonians, AS WISE AS DANIEL (Ezech. 28.3). And his holiness was so great from
  his very childhood, that at the time when he was as yet but a young man, he is joined
  by the SPIRIT of GOD with NOE and JOB, as three persons most eminent for virtue
  and sanctity, Ezech. 14. He is not commonly numbered by the Hebrews among THE PROPHETS:
  because he lived at court, and in high station in the world: but if we consider
  his many clear predictions of things to come, we shall find that no one better deserves
  the name and title of A PROPHET: which also has been given him by the SON of GOD
  himself, Matt. 24, Mark 13., Luke 21.'
