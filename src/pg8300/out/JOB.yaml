  to the more probable opinion, was of the race of Esau; and the same as Jobab, king
  of Edom, mentioned Gen. 36.33. It is uncertain who was the writer of it. Some attribute
  it to Job himself; others to Moses, or some one of the prophets. In the Hebrew it
  is written in verse, from the beginning of the third chapter to the forty-second
  chapter.'
