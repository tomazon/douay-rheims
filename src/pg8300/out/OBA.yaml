intro: 'ABDIAS, whose name is interpreted THE SERVANT OF THE LORD, is believed to
  have prophesied about the same time as OSEE, JOEL, and AMOS: though some of the
  Hebrews, who believe him to be the same with ACHAB''s steward, make him much more
  ancient. His prophecy is the shortest of any in number of words, but yields to none,
  says ST. JEROME, in the sublimity of mysteries. It contains but one chapter.'
