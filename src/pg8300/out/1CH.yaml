intro: 'These Books are called by the Greek interpreters, Paralipomenon, that is,
  of things left out, or omitted; because they are a kind of a supplement of such
  things as were passed over in the books of the Kings. The Hebrews call them Dibre
  Haijamim, that is, The words of the days, or The Chronicles.--Not that they are
  the books which are so often quoted in the Kings, under the title of the words of
  the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Juda: for the books of Paralipomenon
  were written after the books of Kings: but because in all probability they have
  been abridged from those ancient words of the days, by Esdras or some other sacred
  writer.'
