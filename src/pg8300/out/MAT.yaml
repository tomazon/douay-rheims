intro: 'Saint Matthew, one of the twelve Apostles, who from being a publican, that
  is, a taxgatherer, was called by our Saviour to the Apostleship: in that profession
  his name is Levi. (Luke 5.27, and Mark 2.14.) He was the first of the Evangelists
  that wrote the Gospel, and that in Hebrew or Syro-Chaldaic which the Jews in Palestine
  spoke at that time. The original is not now extant; but it was translated in the
  time of the Apostles into Greek, that version was of equal authority. He wrote about
  six years after the Lord''s Ascension.'
