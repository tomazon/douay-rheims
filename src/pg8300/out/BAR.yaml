intro: 'BARUCH was a man of noble extraction, and learned in the law, secretary and
  disciple to the prophet JEREMIAS, and a sharer in his labours and persecutions:
  which is the reason why the ancient fathers have considered this book as a part
  of the prophecy of JEREMIAS, and have usually quoted it under his name.'
