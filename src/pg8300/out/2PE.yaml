intro: 'In this Epistle St. Peter says (chap, 3): Behold this second Epistle I write
  to you: and before (chap. 1,): Being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle
  is at hand. This shews, that it was written a very short time before his martyrdom,
  which was about thirty-five years after our Lord''s Ascension. In this Epistle he
  admonishes the faithful to be mindful of the great gifts they received from God
  and to join all other virtues with their faith. He warns them against false teachers,
  by describing their practices and foretelling their punishments. He describes the
  dissolution of this world by fire and the day of judgment.'
