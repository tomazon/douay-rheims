  recorded: who, being a Gentile, became a convert to the true faith, and marrying
  Booz, the great-grandfather of David, was one of those from whom Christ sprung according
  to the flesh, and an illustrious figure of the Gentile church. It is thought this
  book was written by the prophet Samuel.'
