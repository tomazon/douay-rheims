intro: This Book, which, from the first ages, hath been called, THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES,
  is not to be considered as a history of what was done by all the Apostles, who were
  dispersed into different nations; but only a short view of the first establishment
  of the Christian Church. A part of the preaching and action of St. Peter are related
  in the first twelve chapters; and a particular account of St. Paul's apostolical
  labours in the subsequent chapters. It was written by St. Luke the Evangelist, and
  the original in Greek. Its history commences from the Ascension of Christ our Lord
  and ends in the year sixty-three, being a brief account of the Church for the space
  of about thirty years.
