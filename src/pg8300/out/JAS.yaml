intro: This Epistle is called Catholic or Universal, as formerly were also the two
  Epistles of St. Peter, the first of St. John and that of St. Jude, because they
  were not written to any peculiar people or particular person, but to the faithful
  in general. It was written by the apostle St. James, called the Less, who was also
  called the brother of our Lord, being his kinsman (for cousins german with the Hebrews
  were called brothers). He was the first Bishop of Jerusalem. In this Epistle are
  set forth many precepts appertaining to faith and morals; particularly, that faith
  without good works will not save a man and that true wisdom is given only from above.
  In the fifth chapter he publishes the sacrament of anointing the sick. It was written
  a short time before his martyrdom, about twenty-eight years after our Lord's Ascension.
