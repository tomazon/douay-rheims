intro: 'St. John the Apostle and Evangelist was the son of Zebedee and Salome, brother
  to James the Greater. He was called the Beloved disciple of Christ and stood by
  at his Crucifixion. He wrote the Gospel after the other Evangelists, about sixty-three
  years after our Lord''s Ascension. Many things that they had omitted were supplied
  by him. The original was written in Greek; and by the Greeks he is titled: The Divine,
  St. Jerome relates that, when he was earnestly requested by the brethren to write
  the Gospel, he answered he would do it, if by ordering a common fast, they would
  all put up their prayers together to the Almighty God; which being ended replenished
  with the clearest and fullest revelation coming from Heaven, he burst forth into
  that preface: IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD.'
