    intro:
      - He commends the faith and charity of Philemon; and sends back to him his fugitive
        servant, whom he had converted in prison.
intro: 'Philemon, a noble citizen of Colossa, had a servant named Onesimus, who robbed
  him and fled to Rome, where he met St. Paul, who was then a prisoner there the first
  time. The apostle took compassion on him and received him with tenderness and converted
  him to the faith; for he was a Gentile before. &nbsp;St. Paul sends him back to
  his master with this Epistle in his favour: and though he beseeches Philemon to
  pardon him, yet the Apostle writes with becoming dignity and authority. It contains
  divers profitable instructions and points out the charity and humanity that masters
  should have for their servants.'
