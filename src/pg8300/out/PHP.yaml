intro: The Philippians were the first among the Macedonians converted to the faith.
  They had a great veneration for St. Paul and supplied his wants when he was a prisoner
  in Rome, sending to him by Epaphroditus, by whom he sent this Epistle; in which
  he recommends charity, unity and humility and warns them against false teachers,
  whom he calls dogs and enemies of the cross of Christ. He also returns thanks for
  their benefactions. It was written about twenty-nine years after our Lord's Ascension.
