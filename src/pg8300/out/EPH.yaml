intro: Ephesus was the capital of Lesser Asia, and celebrated for the temple of Diana,
  to which the most part of the people of the East went frequently to worship. But
  St. Paul having preached the Gospel there, for two years the first time and afterwards
  for about a year, converted many. He wrote this Epistle to them when he was a prisoner
  in Rome; and sent it by Tychicus. He admonishes them to hold firmly the faith which
  they had received and warns them, and also those of the neighbouring cities, against
  the sophistry of philosophers and doctrine of false teachers who were come among
  them. The matters of faith contained in this Epistle are exceedingly sublime, and
  consequently very difficult to be understood. It was written about twenty-nine years
  after our Lord's Ascension.
