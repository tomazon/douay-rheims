intro: This and the following Book are called by the holy fathers the third and fourth
  book of Kings; but by the Hebrews, the first and second. They contain the history
  of the kingdoms of Israel and Juda, from the beginning of the reign of Solomon,
  to the captivity. As to the writer of these books, it seems most probable they were
  not written by one man; nor at one time; but as there was all along a succession
  of prophets in Israel, who recorded, by divine inspiration, the most remarkable
  things that happened in their days, these books seem to have been written by these
  prophets. See 2 Paralip. alias 2 Chron. 9.29; 12.15; 13.22; 20.34; 26.22; 32.32.
