intro: 'The same vein of divine love and charity towards our neighbour, which runs
  throughout the Gospel written by the beloved disciple and Evangelist, St. John,
  is found also in his Epistles. He confirms the two principal mysteries of faith:
  The mystery of the Trinity and the mystery of the incarnation of Jesus Christ the
  Son of God. The sublimity and excellence of the evangelical doctrine he declares:
  And this commandment we have from God, that he, who loveth God, love also his brother
  (chap. 4,21). And again: For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments,
  and: His commandments are not heavy (chap. 5,3). &nbsp;He shews how to distinguish
  the children of God from those of the devil: marks out those who should be called
  Antichrists: describes the turpitude and gravity of sin. Finally, he shews how the
  sinner may hope for pardon. It was written, according to Baronius'' account, sixty-six
  years after our Lord''s Ascension.'
