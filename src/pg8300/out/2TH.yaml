intro: In this Epistle St. Paul admonishes the Thessalonians to be constant in the
  faith of Christ and not to be terrified by the insinuations of false teachers telling
  them that the day of judgment was near at hand, as there must come many signs and
  wonders before it. He bids them to hold firm the traditions received from him, whether
  by word, or by epistle, and shews them how they may be certain of his letters by
  the manner he writes.
