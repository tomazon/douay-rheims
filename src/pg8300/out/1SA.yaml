intro: This and the following Book are called by the Hebrews the books of Samuel,
  because they contain the history of Samuel, and of the two kings, Saul and David,
  whom he anointed. They are more commonly named by the Fathers, the first and second
  book of kings. As to the writer of them, it is the common opinion that Samuel composed
  the first book, as far as the twenty-fifth chapter; and that the prophets Nathan
  and Gad finished the first, and wrote the second book. See 1 Paralipomenon, alias
  1 Chronicles, 29.29.
