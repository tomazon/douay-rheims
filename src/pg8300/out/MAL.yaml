intro: MALACHIAS, whose name signifies The Angel of the Lord, was contemporary with
  NEHEMIAS, and by some is believed to have been the same person as ESDRAS. He was
  the last of the prophets, in the order of time, and flourished about four hundred
  years before Christ. He foretells the coming of Christ; the reprobation of the Jews
  and their sacrifices; and the calling of the Gentiles, who shall offer up to God
  in every place an acceptable sacrifice.
