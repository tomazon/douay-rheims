intro: 'JOEL, whose name, according to ST. JEROME, signifies THE LORD GOD: or, as
  others say, THE COMING DOWN OF GOD: prophesied about the same time in the kingdom
  of Judea, as OSEE did in the kingdom of Israel. He foretells under figure the great
  evils that were coming upon the people for their sins: earnestly exhorts them to
  repentance: and comforts them with the promise of a TEACHER OF JUSTICE, viz., CHRIST
  JESUS OUR LORD, and of the coming down of his holy SPIRIT.'
