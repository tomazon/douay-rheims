intro: 'Thessalonica was the capital of Macedonia, in which St. Paul, having preached
  the Gospel, converted some Jews and a great number of the Gentiles: but the unbelieving
  Jews, envying his success, raised such a commotion against him that he, and his
  companion, Sylvanus were obliged to quit the city. Afterwards he went to Athens,
  where he heard that the converts in Thessalonica were under a severe persecution,
  ever since his departure; and lest they should lose their fortitude, he sent Timothy
  to strengthen and comfort them in their sufferings. In the meantime St. Paul came
  to Corinth, where he wrote this first Epistle, and also the second to the Thessalonians,
  both in the same year, being the nineteenth after our Lord''s Ascension. These are
  the first of his Epistles in the order of time.'
