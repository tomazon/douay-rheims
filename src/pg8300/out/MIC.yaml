intro: 'MICHEAS, of Morasti, a little town in the tribe of JUDA, was contemporary
  with the prophet ISAIAS: whom he resembles both in his spirit and his style. He
  is different from the prophet MICHEAS mentioned in the third book of Kings, chap.
  22. For that MICHEAS lived in the days of king ACHAB, one hundred and fifty years
  before the time of EZECHIAS, under whom this MICHEAS prophesied.'
