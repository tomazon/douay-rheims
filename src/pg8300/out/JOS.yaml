intro: 'This Book is called JOSUE, because it contains the history of what passed
  under him, and according to the common opinion was written by him. The Greeks call
  him Jesus: for Josue and Jesus in the Hebrew, are the same name, and have the same
  signification, viz., A SAVIOUR. And it was not without a mystery that he who was
  to bring the people into the land of promise should have his name changed from OSEE
  (for so he was called before, Num. 13.17,) to JOSUE or JESUS, to give us to understand,
  that Moses by his law could only bring the people within sight of the promised inheritance,
  but that our Saviour JESUS was to bring us into it.'
