book_intro: The Philippians were the first among the Macedonians converted to the
  faith. They had a great veneration for St. Paul and supplied his wants when he was
  a prisoner in Rome, sending to him by Epaphroditus, by whom he sent this Epistle;
  in which he recommends charity, unity and humility and warns them against false
  teachers, whom he calls dogs and enemies of the cross of Christ. He also returns
  thanks for their benefactions. It was written about twenty-nine years after our
  Lord’s Ascension.

              be his gain, by putting him presently in possession of heaven; yet he
              is doubtful what he should choose, because by staying longer in the
              flesh, he should be more beneficial to the souls of his neighbours.

      - 'I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you:'
      - 'Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all with joy:'
      - For your communication in the gospel of Christ, from the first day until now.
      - 'Being confident of this very thing: that he who hath begun a good work in
        you will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.'
      - As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my
        heart; and that, in my bands and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel,
        you all are partakers of my joy.
      - For God is my witness how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
      - 'And this I pray: That your charity may more and more abound in knowledge
        and in all understanding:'

        praise of God.
      - 'Now, brethren, I desire you should know that the things which have happened
        to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:'
      - So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court and in all
        other places.
      - And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much
        more bold to speak the word of God without fear.
      - 'Some indeed, even out of envy and contention: but some also for good will
        preach Christ.'
      - Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
      - 'And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they
        raise affliction to my bands.'

        be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.'
      - For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer
        and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
      - 'According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded:
        but with all confidence, as always, so now also, shall Christ be magnified
        in my body, whether it be by life or by death.'
      - 'For to me, to live is Christ: and to die is gain.'
      - 'And if to live in the flesh: this is to me the fruit of labour. And what
        I shall choose I know not.'
      - 'But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be
        with Christ, a thing by far the better.'
      - But to abide still in the flesh is needful for you.
      - 'And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you
        all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:'
      - That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you
        again.
      - 'Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether
        I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast
        in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.'
      - 'And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause
        of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God.'
      - 'For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also
        to suffer for him:'

        of one accord, agreeing in sentiment.
      - 'Let nothing be done through contention: neither by vain glory. But in humility,
        let each esteem others better than themselves:'

        men’s.

        only but much more now in my absence) with fear and trembling work out your
        salvation.
      - For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according

      - And for the selfsame thing, do you also rejoice and congratulate with me.
      - And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also
        may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.
      - For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous
        for you.
      - For all seek the things that are their own not the things that are Jesus Christ’s.

      - 'For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him. And not
        only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.'
      - 'Therefore, I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice,

        as he is.'

      - As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things
        to you, to me indeed is not wearisome, but to you is necessary.
      - 'Beware of dogs: beware of evil workers: beware of the concision.'
      - For we are the circumcision, who in spirit serve God and glory in Christ Jesus,
        not having confidence in the flesh.

        may have confidence in the flesh, I more:'

        Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews. According to the law, a Pharisee:'
      - 'According to zeal, persecuting the church of God: According to the justice
        that is in the law, conversing without blame.'
      - But the things that were gain to me, the same I have counted loss for Christ.

        of Jesus Christ, my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things
        and count them but as dung, that I may gain Christ.'
      - 'And may be found in him, not having my justice, which is of the law, but
        that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus, which is of God: justice in faith.'
      - 'That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship
        of his sufferings: being made conformable to his death,'
      - If by any means I may attain to the resurrection which is from the dead.
      - 'Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect: but I follow
        after, if I may by any means apprehend, wherein I am also apprehended by Christ
        Jesus.'
      - 'Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended. But one thing I do:
        Forgetting the things that are behind and stretching forth myself to those
        that are before,'
      - I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation of God in
        Christ Jesus.
      - 'Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing
        you be otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you,'

        they are enemies of the cross of Christ:'

        their shame: who mind earthly things.'
      - 'But our conversation is in heaven: from whence also we look for the Saviour,
        our Lord Jesus Christ,'

        according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue all things unto
        himself.

        so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.'

        with me in the gospel, with Clement and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose
        names are in the book of life.
      - 'Rejoice in the Lord always: again, I say, rejoice.'
      - Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is nigh.
      - 'Be nothing solicitous: but in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with
        thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.'
      - And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts
        and minds in Christ Jesus.
      - 'For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever
        just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there
        be any virtue, if any praise of discipline: think on these things.'
      - 'The things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in
        me, these do ye: and the God of peace shall be with you.'
      - Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly that now at length your thought for
        me hath flourished again, as you did also think; but you were busied.
      - I speak not as it were for want. For I have learned, in whatsoever state I
        am, to be content therewith.
      - 'I know both how to be brought low, and I know how to abound (every where
        and in all things I am instructed): both to be full and to be hungry: both
        to abound and to suffer need.'
      - I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.
      - Nevertheless, you have done well in communicating to my tribulation.
      - And you also know, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when
        I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving
        and receiving, but you only.
      - For unto Thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use.
      - 'Not that I seek the gift: but I seek the fruit that may abound to your account.'
      - 'But I have all and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus

        to God.'

        Jesus.
      - Now to God and our Father be glory, world without end. Amen.
      - Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus.
      - 'The brethren who are with me salute you. All the saints salute you: especially
        they that are of Caesar’s household.'
      - The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
