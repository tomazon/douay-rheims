    verse:
      - ~
      - 'In the days of Assuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred
        and twenty seven provinces:'
      - When he sat on the throne of his kingdom, the city Susan was the capital of
        his kingdom.
      - Now in the third year of his reign he made a great feast for all the princes,
        and for his servants, for the most mighty of the Persians, and the nobles
        of the Medes, and the governors of the provinces in his sight,
      - That he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the greatness,
        and boasting of his power, for a long time, to wit, for a hundred and fourscore
        days.
      - 'And when the days of the feast were expired, he invited all the people that
        were found in Susan, from the greatest to the least: and commanded a feast
        to be made seven days in the court of the garden, and of the wood, which was
        planted by the care and the hand of the king.'
      - 'And there were hung up on every side sky coloured, and green, and violet
        hangings, fastened with cords of silk, and of purple, which were put into
        rings of ivory, and were held up with marble pillars. The beds also were of
        gold and silver, placed in order upon a floor paved with porphyry and white
        marble: which was embellished with painting of wonderful variety.'
      - And they that were invited, drank in golden cups, and the meats were brought
        in divers vessels one after another. Wine also in abundance and of the best
        was presented, as was worthy of a king’s magnificence.
      - Neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not willing, but
        as the king had appointed, who set over every table one of his nobles, that
        every man might take what he would.
      - Also Vasthi the queen made a feast for the women in the palace, where king
        Assuerus was used to dwell.
      - Now on the seventh day, when the king was merry, and after very much drinking
        was well warmed with wine, he commanded Mauman, and Bazatha, and Harbona,
        and Bagatha, and Abgatha, and Zethar, and Charcas, the seven eunuchs that
        served in his presence,
      - 'To bring in queen Vasthi before the king, with the crown set upon her head,
        to shew her beauty to all the people and the princes: for she was exceeding
        beautiful.'
      - But she refused, and would not come at the king’s commandment, which he had
        signified to her by the eunuchs. Whereupon the king, being angry, and inflamed
        with a very great fury,
      - 'Asked the wise men, who according to the custom of the kings, were always
        near his person, and all he did was by their counsel, who knew the laws, and
        judgments of their forefathers:'
      - (Now the chief and nearest him were, Charsena, and Sethar, and Admatha, and
        Tharsis, and Mares, and Marsana, and Mamuchan, seven princes of the Persians
        and of the Medes, who saw the face of the king, and were used to sit first
        after him:)
      - What sentence ought to pass upon Vasthi the queen, who had refused to obey
        the commandment of king Assuerus, which he had sent to her by the eunuchs?
      - 'And Mamuchan answered, in the hearing of the king and the princes: Queen
        Vasthi hath not only injured the king, but also all the people and princes
        that are in all the provinces of king Assuerus.'
      - 'For this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women, so that they will
        despise their husbands, and will say: King Assuerus commanded that queen Vasthi
        should come in to him, and she would not.'
      - 'And by this example all the wives of the princes of the Persians and the
        Medes will slight the commandments of their husbands: wherefore the king’s
        indignation is just.'
      - If it please thee, let an edict go out from thy presence, and let it be written
        according to the law of the Persians and of the Medes, which must not be altered,
        that Vasthi come in no more to the king, but another, that is better than
        her, be made queen in her place.
      - And let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire, (which
        is very wide,) and let all wives, as well of the greater as of the lesser,
        give honour to their husbands.
      - 'His counsel pleased the king, and the princes: and the king did according
        to the counsel of Mamuchan.'
      - 'And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, as every nation
        could hear and read, in divers languages and characters, that the husbands
        should be rulers and masters in their houses: and that this should be published
        to every people.'
  - chapter_intro: Esther is advanced to be queen. Mardochai detecteth a plot against
      the king.
    chapter_number: 2
    verse:
      - ~
      - 'After this, when the wrath of king Assuerus was appeased, he remembered Vasthi,
        and what she had done and what she had suffered:'
      - 'And the king’s servants and his officers said: Let young women be sought
        for the king, virgins and beautiful,'
      - 'And let some persons be sent through all the provinces to look for beautiful
        maidens and virgins: and let them bring them to the city of Susan, and put
        them into the house of the women under the hand of Egeus the eunuch, who is
        the overseer and keeper of the king’s women: and let them receive women’s
        ornaments, and other things necessary for their use.'
      - 'And whosoever among them all shall please the king’s eyes, let her be queen
        instead of Vasthi. The word pleased the king: and he commanded it should be
        done as they had suggested.'
      - There was a man in the city of Susan, a Jew, named Mardochai, the son of Jair,
        the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the race of Jemini,
      - Who had been carried away from Jerusalem at the time that Nabuchodonosor king
        of Babylon carried away Jechonias king of Juda,
      - 'And he had brought up his brother’s daughter Edissa, who by another name
        was called Esther: now she had lost both her parents: and was exceeding fair
        and beautiful. And her father and mother being dead, Mardochai adopted her
        for his daughter.'
      - 'And when the king’s ordinance was noised abroad, and according to his commandment
        many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus
        the eunuch: Esther also among the rest of the maidens was delivered to him
        to be kept in the number of the women.'
      - And she pleased him, and found favour in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch
        to hasten the women’s ornaments, and to deliver to her her part, and seven
        of the most beautiful maidens of the king’s house, and to adorn and deck out
        both her and her waiting maids.
      - 'And she would not tell him her people nor her country. For Mardochai had
        charged her to say nothing at all of that:'
      - And he walked every day before the court of the house, in which the chosen
        virgins were kept, having a care for Esther’s welfare, and desiring to know
        what would befall her.
      - 'Now when every virgin’s turn came to go in to the king, after all had been
        done for setting them off to advantage, it was the twelfth month: so that
        for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh, and for other six months
        they used certain perfumes and sweet spices.'
      - 'And when they were going in to the king, whatsoever they asked to adorn themselves
        they received: and being decked out, as it pleased them, they passed from
        the chamber of the women to the king’s chamber.'
      - 'And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from thence
        she was conducted to the second house, that was under the hand of Susagaz
        the eunuch, who had the charge over the king’s concubines: neither could she
        return any more to the king, unless the king desired it, and had ordered her
        by name to come.'
      - And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther, the
        daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his
        daughter, was to go in to the king. But she sought not women’s ornaments,
        but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins had a mind, he gave
        her to adorn her. For she was exceeding fair, and her incredible beauty made
        her appear agreeable and amiable in the eyes of all.
      - So she was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth month, which
        is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
      - And the king loved her more than all the women, and she had favour and kindness
        before him above all the women, and he set the royal crown on her head, and
        made her queen instead of Vasthi.
      - And he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the princes, and
        for his servants, for the marriage and wedding of Esther, And he gave rest
        to all the provinces, and bestowed gifts according to princely magnificence.
      - And when the virgins were sought the second time, and gathered together, Mardochai
        stayed at the king’s gate,
      - 'Neither had Esther as yet declared her country and people, according to his
        commandment. For whatsoever he commanded, Esther observed: and she did all
        things in the same manner as she was wont at that time when he brought her
        up a little one.'
      - 'At that time, therefore, when Mardochai abode at the king’s gate, Bagathan
        and Thares, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were porters, and presided in the
        first entry of the palace, were angry: and they designed to rise up against
        the king, and to kill him.'
      - 'And Mardochai had notice of it, and immediately he told it to queen Esther:
        and she to the king in Mardochai’s name, who had reported the thing unto her.'
      - 'It was inquired into, and found out: and they were both hanged on a gibbet.
        And it was put in the histories, and recorded in the chronicles before the
        king.'
  - chapter_intro: Aman, advanced by the king, is offended at Mardochai, and therefore
      procureth the king’s decree to destroy the whole nation of the Jews.
    chapter_number: 3
    verse:
      - ~
      - 'After these things, king Assuerus advanced Aman, the son of Amadathi, who
        was of the race of Agag: and he set his throne above all the princes that
        were with him.'
      - 'And all the king’s servants, that were at the doors of the palace, bent their
        knees, and worshipped Aman: for so the emperor had commanded them, only Mardochai
        did not bend his knee, nor worship him.'
      - 'And the king’s servants that were chief at the doors of the palace, said
        to him: Why dost thou alone not observe the king’s commandment?'
      - 'And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them, they
        told Aman, desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution: for
        he had told them that he was a Jew.'
      - Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai
        did not bend his knee to him, nor worship him, he was exceeding angry.
      - 'And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone: for he had
        heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he chose rather to destroy
        all the nation of the Jews that were in the kingdom of Assuerus.'
      - 'In the first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign
        of Assuerus, the lot was cast into an urn, which in Hebrew is called Phur,
        before Aman, on what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be destroyed:
        and there came out the twelfth month, which is called Adar.'
      - 'And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through all the
        provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws
        and ceremonies, and moreover despise the king’s ordinances: and thou knowest
        very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent
        by impunity.'
      - If it please thee, decree that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand
        talents to thy treasurers.
      - And the king took the ring that he used, from his own hand, and gave it to
        Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy of the Jews,
      - 'And he said to him: As to the money which thou promisest, keep it for thyself:
        and as to the people, do with them as seemeth good to thee.'
      - 'And the king’s scribes were called in the first month Nisan, on the thirteenth
        day of the same month: and they wrote, as Aman had commanded, to all the king’s
        lieutenants, and to the judges of the provinces, and of divers nations, as
        every nation could read, and hear according to their different languages,
        in the name of king Assuerus: and the letters, sealed with his ring,'
      - Were sent by the king’s messengers to all provinces, to kill and destroy all
        the Jews, both young and old, little children, and women, in one day, that
        is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called Adar, and to make
        a spoil of their goods.
      - And the contents of the letters were to this effect, that all provinces might
        know and be ready against that day.
      - The couriers that were sent made haste to fulfil the king’s commandment. And
        immediately the edict was hung up in Susan, the king and Aman feasting together,
        and all the Jews that were in the city weeping.
  - chapter_intro: Mardochai desireth Esther to petition the king for the Jews. They
      join in fasting and prayer.
    chapter_number: 4
    verse:
      - ~
      - Now when Mardochai had heard these things, he rent his garments, and put on
        sackcloth, strewing ashes on his head and he cried with a loud voice in the
        street in the midst of the city, shewing the anguish of his mind.
      - 'And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the palace: for
        no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the king’s court.'
      - And in all provinces, towns, and places, to which the king’s cruel edict was
        come, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, wailing, and
        weeping, many using sackcloth and ashes for their bed.
      - 'Then Esther’s maids and her eunuchs went in, and told her. And when she heard
        it she was in a consternation and she sent a garment, to clothe him, and to
        take away the sackcloth: but he would not receive it.'
      - And she called for Athach the eunuch, whom the king had appointed to attend
        upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and learn of him why he
        did this.
      - 'And Athach going out went to Mardochai, who was standing in the street of
        the city, before the palace gate:'
      - And Mardochai told him all that had happened, how Aman had promised to pay
        money into the king’s treasures, to have the Jews destroyed.
      - He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in Susan, that he
        should shew it to the queen, and admonish her to go in to the king, and to
        entreat him for her people.
      - And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.
      - 'She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:'
      - 'All the king’s servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion,
        know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the king’s inner court,
        who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any delay:
        except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency,
        that so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who for these thirty
        days now have not been called unto him?'
      - And when Mardochai had heard this,
      - 'He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy
        life only, because thou art in the king’s house, more than all the Jews:'
      - 'For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered by some
        other occasion: and thou, and thy father’s house shall perish. And who knoweth
        whether thou art not therefore come to the kingdom, that thou mightest be
        ready in such a time as this?'
      - 'And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:'
      - 'Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan, and pray
        ye for me. Neither eat nor drink for three days and three nights: and I with
        my handmaids will fast in like manner, and then I will go in to the king,
        against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.'
      - So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him.
  - chapter_intro: 'Esther is graciously received: she inviteth the king and Aman
      to dinner, Aman prepareth a gibbet for Mardochai.'
    chapter_number: 5
    verse:
      - ~
      - 'And on the third day Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner
        court of the king’s house, over against the king’s hall: now he sat upon his
        throne in the hall of the palace, over against the door of the house.'
      - And when he saw Esther the queen standing, she pleased his eyes, and he held
        out toward her the golden sceptre, which he held in his hand and she drew
        near, and kissed the top of his sceptre.
      - 'And the king said to her: What wilt thou, queen Esther? what is thy request?
        if thou shouldst even ask one half of the kingdom, it shall be given to thee.'
      - 'But she answered: If it please the king, I beseech thee to come to me this
        day, and Aman with thee to the banquet which I have prepared.'
      - 'And the king said forthwith: Call ye Aman quickly, that he may obey Esther’s
        will. So the king and Aman came to the banquet which the queen had prepared
        for them.'
      - 'And the king said to her, after he had drunk wine plentifully: What dost
        thou desire should be given thee? and for what thing askest thou? although
        thou shouldst ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.'
      - 'And Esther answered: My petition and request is this:'
      - 'If I have found favour in the king’s sight, and if it please the king to
        give me what I ask, and to fulfil my petition: let the king and Aman come
        to the banquet which I have prepared them, and to morrow I will open my mind
        to the king.'
      - 'So Aman went out that day joyful and merry. And when he saw Mardochai sitting
        before the gate of the palace, and that he not only did not rise up to honour
        him, but did not so much as move from the place where he sat, he was exceedingly
        angry:'
      - 'But dissembling his anger, and returning into his house, he called together
        to him his friends, and Zares his wife:'
      - And he declared to them the greatness of his riches, and the multitude of
        his children, and with how great glory the king had advanced him above all
        his princes and servants.
      - 'And after this he said: Queen Esther also hath invited no other to the banquet
        with the king, but me: and with her I am also to dine to morrow with the king:'
      - And whereas I have all these things, I think I have nothing, so long as I
        see Mardochai the Jew sitting before the king’s gate.
      - 'Then Zares his wife, and the rest of his friends answered him: Order a great
        beam to be prepared, fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king,
        that Mardochai may be hanged upon it, and so thou shalt go full of joy with
        the king to the banquet. The counsel pleased him, and he commanded a high
        gibbet to be prepared.'

    verse:
      - ~
      - That night the king passed without sleep, and he commanded the histories and
        chronicles of former times to be brought him. And when they were reading them
        before him,
      - They came to that place where it was written, how Mardochai had discovered
        the treason of Bagathan and Thares the eunuchs, who sought to kill king Assuerus.
      - 'And when the king heard this, he said: What honour and reward hath Mardochai
        received for this fidelity? His servants and ministers said to him: He hath
        received no reward at all.'
      - 'And the king said immediately: Who is in the court? for Aman was coming in
        to the inner court of the king’s house, to speak to the king, that he might
        order Mardochai to be hanged upon the gibbet, which was prepared for him.'
      - 'The servants answered: Aman standeth in the court, and the king said: Let
        him come in.'
      - 'And when he was come in, he said to him: What ought to be done to the man
        whom the king is desirous to honour? But Aman thinking in his heart, and supposing
        that the king would honour no other but himself,'
      - 'Answered: The man whom the king desireth to honour,'
      - Ought to be clothed with the king’s apparel, and to be set upon the horse
        that the king rideth upon, and to have the royal crown upon his head,
      - 'And let the first of the king’s princes and nobles hold his horse, and going
        through the street of the city, proclaim before him and say: Thus shall he
        be honoured, whom the king hath a mind to honour.'
      - 'And the king said to him: Make haste and take the robe and the horse, and
        do as thou hast spoken to Mardochai the Jew, who sitteth before the gates
        of the palace. Beware thou pass over any of those things which thou hast spoken.'
      - 'So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arraying Mardochai in the street
        of the city, and setting him on the horse, went before him, and proclaimed:
        This honour is he worthy of, whom the king hath a mind to honour.'
      - 'But Mardochai returned to the palace gate: and Aman made haste to go to his
        house, mourning and having his head covered:'
      - 'And he told Zares his wife, and his friends, all that had befallen him. And
        the wise men whom he had in counsel, and his wife answered him: If Mardochai
        be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou canst
        not resist him, but thou shalt fall in his sight.'
      - As they were yet speaking, the king’s eunuchs came, and compelled him to go
        quickly to the banquet which the queen had prepared.

      the gibbet he had prepared for Mardochai.'

    verse:
      - ~
      - So the king and Aman went in, to drink with the queen.
      - 'And the king said to her again the second day, after he was warm with wine:
        What is thy petition, Esther, that it may be granted thee? and what wilt thou
        have done: although thou ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.'
      - 'Then she answered: If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it
        please thee, give me my life for which I ask, and my people for which I request.'
      - 'For we are given up, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to
        perish. And would God we were sold for bondmen and bondwomen: the evil might
        be borne with, and I would have mourned in silence: but now we have an enemy,
        whose cruelty redoundeth upon the king.'
      - 'And king Assuerus answered and said: Who is this, and of what power, that
        he should do these things?'
      - 'And Esther said: It is this Aman that is our adversary and most wicked enemy.
        Aman hearing this was forthwith astonished, not being able to bear the countenance
        of the king and of the queen.'
      - But the king being angry rose up, and went from the place of the banquet into
        the garden set with trees. Aman also rose up to entreat Esther the queen for
        his life, for he understood that evil was prepared for him by the king.
      - 'And when the king came back out of the garden set with trees, and entered
        into the place of the banquet, he found Aman was fallen upon the bed on which
        Esther lay, and he said: He will force the queen also in my presence, in my
        own house. The word was not yet gone out of the king’s mouth, and immediately
        they covered his face.'
      - 'And Harbona, one of the eunuchs that stood waiting on the king, said: Behold
        the gibbet which he hath prepared for Mardochai, who spoke for the king, standeth
        in Aman’s house, being fifty cubits high. And the king said to him: Hang him
        upon it.'
      - 'So Aman was hanged on the gibbet, which he had prepared for Mardochai: and
        the king’s wrath ceased.'

    verse:
      - ~
      - On that day king Assuerus gave the house of Aman, the Jews’ enemy, to queen
        Esther, and Mardochai came in before the king. For Esther had confessed to
        him that he was her uncle.
      - And the king took the ring which he had commanded to be taken again from Aman,
        and gave it to Mardochai. And Esther set Mardochai over her house.
      - And not content with these things, she fell down at the king’s feet and wept,
        and speaking to him besought him, that he would give orders that the malice
        of Aman the Agagite, and his most wicked devices which he had invented against
        the Jews, should be of no effect.
      - 'But he, as the manner was, held out the golden sceptre with his hand, which
        was the sign of clemency: and she arose up and stood before him,'
      - 'And said: If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight,
        and my request be not disagreeable to him, I beseech thee, that the former
        letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews, by which he commanded that
        they should be destroyed in all the king’s provinces, may be reversed by new
        letters.'
      - For how can I endure the murdering and slaughter of my people?
      - 'And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen, and Mardochai the Jew: I have
        given Aman’s house to Esther, and I have commanded him to be hanged on a gibbet,
        because he durst lay hands on the Jews.'
      - Write ye therefore to the Jews, as it pleaseth you in the king’s name, and
        seal the letters with my ring. For this was the custom, that no man durst
        gainsay the letters which were sent in the king’s name, and were sealed with
        his ring.
      - 'Then the king’s scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was the time
        of the third month which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the
        month, and letters were written, as Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and
        to the governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers
        over the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia:
        to province and province, to people and people, according to their languages
        and characters, and to the Jews, according as they could read and hear.'
      - 'And these letters which were sent in the king’s name, were sealed with his
        ring, and sent by posts: who were to run through all the provinces, to prevent
        the former letters with new messages.'
      - And the king gave orders to them, to speak to the Jews in every city, and
        to command them to gather themselves together, and to stand for their lives,
        and to kill and destroy all their enemies with their wives and children and
        all their houses, and to take their spoil.
      - And one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces, to wit, the
        thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar.
      - And this was the content of the letter, that it should be notified in all
        lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king Assuerus, that the
        Jews were ready to be revenged of their enemies.
      - So the swift posts went out carrying the messages, and the king’s edict was
        hung up in Susan.
      - And Mardochai going forth out of the palace, and from the king’s presence,
        shone in royal apparel, to wit, of violet and sky colour, wearing a golden
        crown on his head, and clothed with a cloak of silk and purple. And all the
        city rejoiced, and was glad.
      - But to the Jews, a new light seemed to rise, joy, honour, and dancing.
      - 'And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the king’s commandments
        came, there was wonderful rejoicing, feasts and banquets, and keeping holy
        day: Insomuch that many of other nations and religion, joined themselves to
        their worship and ceremonies. For a great dread of the name of the Jews had
        fallen upon all.'

    verse:
      - ~
      - So on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which as we have said above
        is called Adar, when all the Jews were designed to be massacred, and their
        enemies were greedy after their blood, the case being altered, the Jews began
        to have the upper hand, and to revenge themselves of their adversaries.
      - And they gathered themselves together in every city, and town, and place,
        to lay their hands on their enemies, and their persecutors. And no one durst
        withstand them, for the fear of their power had gone through every people.
      - 'And the judges of the provinces, and the governors, and lieutenants, and
        every one in dignity, that presided over every place and work, extolled the
        Jews for fear of Mardochai:'
      - 'For they knew him to be prince of the palace, and to have great power: and
        the fame of his name increased daily, and was spread abroad through all men’s
        mouths.'
      - 'So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies, and killed them, repaying
        according to what they had prepared to do to them:'
      - 'Insomuch that even in Susan they killed five hundred men, besides the ten
        sons of Aman the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews: whose names are these:'
      - Pharsandatha, and Delphon, and Esphatha
      - And Phoratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
      - And Phermesta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Jezatha.
      - And when they had slain them, they would not touch the spoils of their goods.
      - And presently the number of them that were killed in Susan was brought to
        the king.
      - 'And he said to the queen: The Jews have killed five hundred men in the city
        of Susan, besides the ten sons of Aman: how many dost thou think they have
        slain in all the provinces? What askest thou more, and what wilt thou have
        me to command to be done?'
      - 'And she answered: If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews, to
        do to morrow in Susan as they have done to day, and that the ten sons of Aman
        may be hanged upon gibbets.'
      - And the king commanded that it should be so done. And forthwith the edict
        was hung up in Susan, and the ten sons of Aman were hanged.
      - 'And on the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews gathered themselves
        together, and they killed in Susan three hundred men: but they took not their
        substance.'
      - 'Moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the king’s dominion
        the Jews stood for their lives, and slew their enemies and persecutors: insomuch
        that the number of them that were killed amounted to seventy-five thousand,
        and no man took any of their goods.'
      - Now the thirteenth day of the month Adar was the first day with them all of
        the slaughter, and on the fourteenth day they left off. Which they ordained
        to be kept holy day, so that all times hereafter they should celebrate it
        with feasting, joy, and banquets.
      - 'But they that were killing in the city of Susan, were employed in the slaughter
        on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month: and on the fifteenth
        day they rested. And therefore they appointed that day to be a holy day of
        feasting and gladness.'
      - But those Jews that dwelt in towns not walled and in villages, appointed the
        fourteenth day of the month Adar for banquets and gladness, so as to rejoice
        on that day, and send one another portions of their banquets and meats.
      - And Mardochai wrote all these things, and sent them comprised in letters to
        the Jews that abode in all the king’s provinces, both those that lay near
        and those afar off,
      - 'That they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month Adar
        for holy days, and always at the return of the year should celebrate them
        with solemn honour:'
      - Because on those days the Jews revenged themselves of their enemies, and their
        mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy, and that these should
        be days of feasting and gladness, in which they should send one to another
        portions of meats, and should give gifts to the poor.
      - And the Jews undertook to observe with solemnity all they had begun to do
        at that time, which Mardochai by letters had commanded to be done.
      - For Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy and adversary
        of the Jews, had devised evil against them, to kill them and destroy them;
        and had cast Phur, that is, the lot.
      - 'And afterwards Esther went in to the king, beseeching him that his endeavours
        might be made void by the king’s letters: and the evil that he had intended
        against the Jews, might return upon his own head. And so both he and his sons
        were hanged upon gibbets.'
      - 'And since that time these days are called Phurim, that is, of lots: because
        Phur, that is, the lot, was cast into the urn. And all things that were done,
        are contained in the volume of this epistle, that is, of this book:'
      - 'And the things that they suffered, and that were afterwards changed, the
        Jews took upon themselves and their seed, and upon all that had a mind to
        be joined to their religion, so that it should be lawful for none to pass
        these days without solemnity: which the writing testifieth, and certain times
        require, as the years continually succeed one another.'
      - 'These are the days which shall never be forgot: and which all provinces in
        the whole world shall celebrate throughout all generations: neither is there
        any city wherein the days of Phurim, that is, of lots, must not be observed
        by the Jews, and by their posterity, which is bound to these ceremonies.'
      - And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mardochai the Jew, wrote
        also a second epistle, that with all diligence this day should be established
        a festival for the time to come.
      - And they sent to all the Jews that were in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces
        of king Assuerus, that they should have peace, and receive truth,
      - 'And observe the days of lots, and celebrate them with joy in their proper
        time: as Mardochai and Esther had appointed, and they undertook them to be
        observed by themselves and by their seed, fasts, and cries, and the days of
        lots,'

      - (For I would willingly and readily for the salvation of Israel have kissed
        even the steps of his feet,)

      - And that thy handmaid hath never rejoiced, since I was brought hither unto
        this day but in thee, O Lord, the God of Abraham.
      - O God, who art mighty above all, hear the voice of them, that have no other
        hope, and deliver us from the hand of the wicked, and deliver me from my fear.

    verse:
      - ~
      - And he commanded her (no doubt but he was Mardochai) to go to the king, and
        petition for her people, and for her country.
      - Remember, (said he,) the days of thy low estate, how thou wast brought up
        by my hand, because Aman the second after the king hath spoken against us
        unto death.
      - And do thou call upon the Lord, and speak to the king for us, and deliver
        us from death.
      - And on the third day she laid away the garments she wore, and put on her glorious
        apparel.
      - And glittering in royal robes, after she had called upon God the ruler and
        Saviour of all, she took two maids with her,
      - And upon one of them she leaned, as if for delicateness and overmuch tenderness
        she were not able to bear up her own body.
      - And the other maid followed her lady, bearing up her train flowing on the
        ground.
      - But she with a rosy colour in her face, and with gracious and bright eyes
        hid a mind full of anguish, and exceeding great fear.
      - So going in she passed through all doors in order, and stood before the king,
        where he sat upon his royal throne, clothed with his royal robes, and glittering
        with gold, and precious stones, and he was terrible to behold.
      - And when he had lifted up his countenance, and with burning eyes had shewn
        the wrath of his heart, the queen sunk down, and her colour turned pale, and
        she rested her weary head upon her handmaid.
      - 'And God changed the king’s spirit into mildness, and all in haste and in
        fear he leaped from his throne, and holding her up in his arms, till she came
        to herself, caressed her with these words:'
      - What is the matter, Esther? I am thy brother, fear not.
      - 'Thou shalt not die: for this law is not made for thee, but for all others.'
      - Come near then, and touch the sceptre.
      - 'And as she held her peace, he took the golden sceptre, and laid it upon her
        neck, and kissed her, and said: Why dost thou not speak to me?'
      - 'She answered: I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled
        for fear of thy majesty.'
      - For thou, my lord, art very admirable, and thy face is full of graces.
      - And while she was speaking, she fell down again, and was almost in a swoon.
      - But the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her.

    verse:
      - ~
      - The great king Artaxerxes, from India to Ethiopia, to the governors and princes
        of a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, which obey our command, sendeth greeting.
      - 'Many have abused unto pride the goodness of princes, and the honour that
        hath been bestowed upon them:'
      - And not only endeavour to oppress the king’s subjects, but not bearing the
        glory that is given them, take in hand, to practise also against them that
        gave it.
      - Neither are they content not to return thanks for benefits received, and to
        violate in themselves the laws of humanity, but they think they can also escape
        the justice of God who seeth all things.
      - And they break out into so great madness, as to endeavour to undermine by
        lies such as observe diligently the offices committed to them, and do all
        things in such manner as to be worthy of all men’s praise,
      - While with crafty fraud they deceive the ears of princes that are well meaning,
        and judge of others by their own nature.
      - Now this is proved both from ancient histories, and by the things which are
        done daily, how the good designs of kings are depraved by the evil suggestions
        of certain men.
      - Wherefore we must provide for the peace of all provinces.
      - Neither must you think, if we command different things, that it cometh of
        the levity of our mind, but that we give sentence according to the quality
        and necessity of times, as the profit of the commonwealth requireth.
      - 'Now that you may more plainly understand what we say, Aman the son of Amadathi,
        a Macedonian both in mind and country, and having nothing of the Persian blood,
        but with his cruelty staining our goodness, was received being a stranger
        by us:'
      - 'And found our humanity so great towards him, that he was called our father,
        and was worshipped by all as the next man after the king:'
      - But he was so far puffed up with arrogancy, as to go about to deprive us of
        our kingdom and life.
      - 'For with certain new and unheard of devices he hath sought the destruction
        of Mardochai, by whose fidelity and good services our life was saved, and
        of Esther the partner of our kingdom with all their nation:'
      - Thinking that after they were slain, he might work treason against us left
        alone without friends, and might transfer the kingdom of the Persians to the
        Macedonians.
      - But we have found that the Jews, who were by that most wicked man appointed
        to be slain, are in no fault at all, but contrariwise, use just laws,
      - And are the children of the highest and the greatest, and the ever living
        God, by whose benefit the kingdom was given both to our fathers and to us,
        and is kept unto this day.
      - Wherefore know ye that those letters which he sent in our name, are void and
        of no effect.
      - 'For which crime both he himself that devised it, and all his kindred hang
        on gibbets, before the gates of this city Susan: not we, but God repaying
        him as he deserved.'
      - But this edict, which we now send, shall be published in all cities, that
        the Jews may freely follow their own laws.
      - And you shall aid them that they may kill those who had prepared themselves
        to kill them, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is called
        Adar.
      - For the almighty God hath turned this day of sadness and mourning into joy
        to them.
      - Wherefore you shall also count this day among other festival days, and celebrate
        it with all joy, that it may be known also in times to come,
      - 'That all they who faithfully obey the Persians, receive a worthy reward for
        their fidelity: but they that are traitors to their kingdom, are destroyed
        for their wickedness.'
      - And let every province and city, that will not be partaker of this solemnity,
        perish by the sword and by fire, and be destroyed in such manner as to be
        made unpassable, both to men and beasts, for an example of contempt, and disobedience.
