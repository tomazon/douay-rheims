        the prophet:'

        found in their abode at Ierusalem.
      - In the eightenth yeare, Iosias reigning was the Phase celebrated.
      - 'And the workes of Iosias were directed in the sight of his Lord in a hart
        ful of feare:'

        that sinned, and were irreligous against our Lord aboue al nations, and that
        sought not the wordes of our Lord vpon Israel.

        goe downe in hast.'
      - 'And Iosias did not returne vpon his chariote: but endeuoured to ouerthrow
        him, not attending the word of the prophet from the mouth of our Lord:'
      - but he made battel against him in the field of Mageddo. And princes went downe
        to king Iosias.
      - 'And the king said to his seruantes: Remoue me from the battel, for I am weakned
        excedingly. And forthwith his seruantes remoued him out of the battel.'
      - 'And he went vp into his second chariote: & comming to Ierusalem, dyed, and
        was buried in his fathers sepulchre.'
      - And in al Iurie they mourned for Iosias, & the rulers with their wiues lamented
        him vntil this day. And this was geuen out to be done alwayes vnto al the
        stocke of Israel.
      - 'But these thinges were writen before in the booke of the histories of the
        kinges of Iuda: and al the actes of the doing of Iosias, and his glorie and
        his vnderstanding in the law of our Lord: and the thinges that were done by
        him, and that are not writen in the booke of the kinges of Israel and Iuda.'
      - And they that were of the nation, taking Iechonias the sonne of Iosias, made

        one talent.

      - 'Ioacim was fiue and twentie yeares old when he began to reigne in the land
        of Iuda and Ierusalem: and he did euil in the sight of our Lord.'

        him with a bande of brasse, brought him into Babylon.

        and consecrated them in his temple in Babylon.

        which were spoken by Ieremie the prophet from the mouth of our Lord:<cross_ref>Jer
        37:2</cross_ref>
      - 'and being sworne of king Nabuchodonosor, forsworne he did reuolt: and his
        necke being hardened, & his hart, he transgressed the ordinances of our Lord
        the God of Israel.'
      - 'And the princes of the people of our Lord did manie thinges wickedly, and
        they did impiously aboue al the vncleannes of the nations: and they polluted
        the temple of our Lord that was holie of Ierusalem.'
      - And the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to reclame them, for that
        he would spare them, and his tabernacle.
      - 'But they scorned at his messengers: and in the day that our Lord spake to
        them, they were mocking his prophetes.'
      - Who was moued euen vnto wrath vpon his nation for their impietie, and commanded
        the kinges of the Chaldees to come vp.
      - 'These slewe their yong men with the sword, round about their holie temple,
        and spared not yong man, and old man, and virgin, and youth:'

        our Lord, and the kinges treasures, they caried them into Babylon,'
      - 'and burnt the house of our Lord, and threwe downe the walles of Ierusalem:
        and the towres therof they burnt with fire,'
      - and consumed al their honorable thinges, and brought them to naught, and those
        that were left of the sword, they led into Babylon.
      - And they were his seruants vntil the Persians reigned in the fulfilling of
        the word of our Lord by the mouth of Ieremie:<cross_ref>Jer 25:12 / Jer 29:10
        / Dan 9:2</cross_ref>
      - as long as the land quietly kept her sabbathes, al the time of her desolation
        she sabbathized in the application of seuentie yeares.
  - chapter_intro: 'Cyrus king of Persia permitteth the Iewes to returne into their
      countrie: 10. and deliuereth to them the holie vessels, which Nabuchodonosor

      - and hath signified to me to build him a house in Ierusalem, which is in Iurie.

      - And now be it knowen to our Lord the king, that Iewes came vp from you to
        vs, coming into Ierusalem a rebellious, & very naughty citie, do build the
        fornaces thereof, and set vp the walles, and rayse the temple.
      - And if this citie, and the walles shal be finished, they wil not onlie not
        abyde to pay tributes, but also wil resist the kinges.
      - 'And because that is in doing about the temple, we thought it should doe wel

      - but to make it knowen to our Lord the king, that if it shal seme good, o king
        it may be sought in the bookes of thy fathers,
      - and thou shalt find in the recordes, thinges writen of these, and thou shalt
        know that this citie hath bene rebellious, and trubling kinges, and cities,
      - and the Iewes rebelles, & making battels in it from time out of mind, for
        the which cause this citie was made desolate.
      - Now therfore we doe thee to vnderstand, Lord king, that if this citie shal
        be built, and the walles therof shal be erected, there wil be no comming downe
        for thee into Caelesyria, & Phenice.
      - 'Then wrote the king to Rathimus, the writer of the occurrentes, and to Balthemus,
        and to Sabellius the scribe, and to the rest ioyned with them, and to the
        dwellers in Syria, and Phenice, as foloweth:'
      - I haue read the epistle that you sent me. I commanded therfore search to be
        made, & it was found that the same citie is from the beginning rebellious
        to kinges,
      - and the men rebelles, and making battels in it, & there were most valient
        kinges ruling in Ierusalem, and exacting tributes in Caelesyria, & Phenice.
      - 'Now therfore I haue geuen commandment to forbid those men to build the citie,
        and to stay them that nothing be done more then is:'

    verse:
      - ~
      - KING Darius made a great supper to al his domestical seruantes, and to al
        the magistrates of Media and Persia,
      - and to al that were purple, and to the praetors, and counsuls, and liuetenantes
        vnder him from India vnto AEthiopia, an hundred twentie seuen prouinces.
      - And when they had eaten and drunken, and returned ful, then Darius went vp
        into his chamber, and slept, and awaked.
      - Then those three youngmen kepers of his bodie, which garded the kings bodie,
        sayd one to an other;
      - 'Let euerie one of vs say a word that may excel: & whose word soeuer shal
        appeare wiser then the others, to him wil king Darius geue great giftes,'
      - 'to be couered with purple, & to drinke in gold, and to sleepe vpon gold,
        & a chariote with a bridle of gold, & a bonet of silke, and a cheyne about
        his necke:'
      - and he shal sit in the second place next Darius for his wisdome. And he shal
        be called the cosin of Darius.
      - Then euerie one writing his word signed it, and they put it vnder the pillow
        of Darius the king,
      - 'and they sayd. When the king shal rise, we wil geue him our writinges: and
        which soeuer of the three the king shal iudge, and the magistrates of Persia,
        that his word is the wiser, to him shal the victorie be geuen as is writen.'
      - 'One wrote: Wine is strong.'
      - An other wrote, a King is stronger.
      - 'The third wrote, Wemen are more strong: but aboue al thinges truth ouercometh.'
      - And when the king was risen, they tooke their writinges, and gaue him, and
        he read.
      - And sending he called al the Magistrates of Persians, and the Medes, and them
        that weare purple, and the pretors, and the ouerseers;
      - 'and they sate in the councel: and the writinges were read before them.'
      - 'And he sayd: Cal the youngmen, and they shal declare their owne wordes. And
        they were called, and went in.'
      - 'And he sayd to them: Declare vnto vs concerning these thinges which are writen.
        And the first began, he that had spoken of the strength of wine,'
      - 'and sayd: O ye men, how doth wine preuaile ouer al men that drinke! it seduceth
        the minde.'
      - And also the mind of king and orphane it maketh vaine. Also of the bondman
        and the free, of the rich man and the poore,
      - and euerie mind it turneth into securitie and pleasantnes, and it remembreth
        not any sorow and dewtie,
      - and al hartes it maketh honest, and it remembreth not king, nor magistrate,
        and it maketh a man speake al thinges by talentes.
      - 'And when they haue drunke, they remember not frendship, nor brotherhood:
        yea and not long after they take swordes.'
      - And when they are recouered and risen from the wine, they remember not what
        they haue done.
      - O ye men, doth not wine excel? who thinketh to doe so? And hauing sayd this,
        he held his peace.
  - chapter_intro: 'The second prayseth the excellencie of a king: 13. The third (which
      is Zorobabel) commendeth wemen: 33. but preferreth truth aboue al. 41. VVhich
      is so approued, and he is rewarded. 42. The king moreouer at his request restoreth

      - O ye men doe not the men excel, which obteyne land and sea, and al thinges
        that are in them?
      - 'But a king excelleth aboue al thinges, and hath dominion ouer them: and euerie
        thing whatsoeuer he shal say to them, they doe.'
      - And if he send them to warryers, they goe, and throw downe mountaines, and
        the walles, and towers.
      - 'They kil, and are killed: and the kinges word they transgresse not. For if
        they shal ouercome, they bring to the king al thinges whatsoeuer they haue
        taken for a praye.'
      - 'In like maner also al others, for so many as are not souldiars, nor fight,
        but til the ground: when they shal reape, againe they bring tributes to the
        king.'
      - 'And he being one onlie if he say: Kil ye, they kil: say he: forgeue, the
        forgeue.'
      - 'say he: strike: they strike: say he, destroy, they destroy: say he build,
        they build.'
      - 'say he, cut downe, they cut downe, say he plant, they plant:'
      - and al the people, & potestates here him, and beside this he sitteth downe,
        and drinketh, and sleepeth.
      - And others gard him round about, and can not goe euerie one, and doe their
        owne workes, but at a word are obedient to him.
      - O ye men, how doth not a king excel that is so renowmed? And he held his peace.
      - The third that spake of wemen and truth, this is Zorobabel, began to speake.
      - O ye men, not the great king, & many men, neither is it wine that dothe excel.
        Who is it then that hath the dominion of them?
      - 'Haue not wemen brought forth the king, and al the people, that ruleth ouer
        land & sea:'
      - and were they not borne of them, and did not they bring vp them which planted
        the vineyardes, whereof wine is made?
      - And they make the garmentes of al men, & they doe honor to al men, and men
        can not be separed from wemen.
      - If they haue gathered gold and siluer, and euerie beutiful thing, & see a
        woman comelie and fayre,
      - leauing al these thinges they fixe their looke vpon her, & with open mouth
        beholde her, and allure her more then gold and siluer, and euerie precious
        thing.
      - Man forsaketh his father that brought him vp, and his countrie, and ioyneth
        himself to a woman.
      - 'And with a woman he refresheth his soul: and neither doth he remember father,
        nor mother, nor countrie.'
      - And hereby you must know that wemen rule ouer you. Are you not sorie?
      - And a man taketh his sword, & goeth into the way to commit theftes and murders,
        & to sayle seas & riuers,
      - 'and seeth a lyon, and goeth in darkenes: and when he hath committed theft,
        and fraude, and spoyles, he bringeth it to his beloued.'
      - And againe, man loueth his wife more then father or mother.
      - 'And many haue become madde for their wiues: and haue been made bondmen for

        and power, and maiestie of worldes. Blessed be the God of truth.
      - 'And he left speaking. And al the people cryed, and sayd: Great is truth and
        it preuaileth.'
      - 'Then the king sayd to him: Aske, if thou wilt any more, then the thinges
        that are writen, and I wil geue it thee, according as thou art found wiser
        then thy neighbours, & thou shalt sitte next to me, and shalt be called my
