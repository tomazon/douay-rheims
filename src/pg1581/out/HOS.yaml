book_intro: OSEE, or Hosea, whose name signifies A saviour, was the first in the order
  of time among those who are commonly called lesser prophets, because their prophecies
  are short. He prophesied in the kingdom of Israel, that is, of the ten tribes, about
  the same time that Isaias prophesied in the kingdom of Juda.
