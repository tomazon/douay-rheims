book_intro: 'This Book is called the Canticle of Canticles, that is to say, the most
  excellent of all canticles: because it is full of high mysteries, relating to the
  happy union of Christ and his spouse: which is here begun by love; and is to be
  eternal in heaven. The spouse of Christ is the church: more especially as to the
  happiest part of it, viz., perfect souls, every one of which is his beloved, but,
  above all others, the immaculate and ever blessed virgin mother.'

      - My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the bed of aromatical spices,
        to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
      - I to my beloved, and my beloved to me, who feedeth among the lilies.
      - Thou art beautiful, O my love, sweet and comely as Jerusalem terrible as an
        army set in array.
      - Turn away thy eyes from me, for they have made me flee away. Thy hair is as
        a flock of goats, that appear from Galaad.
      - Thy teeth as a flock of sheep, which come up from the washing, all with twins,
        and there is none barren among them.
      - Thy cheeks are as the bark of a pomegranate, beside what is hidden within
        thee.
      - There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and young maidens without
        number.
      - 'One is my dove, my perfect one is but one, she is the only one of her mother,
        the chosen of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and declared her most
        blessed: the queens and concubines, and they praised her.'
      - Who is she that cometh forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, bright
        as the sun, terrible as an army set in array?
      - I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valleys, and
        to look if the vineyard had flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
      - 'I knew not: my soul troubled me for the chariots of Aminadab.'
