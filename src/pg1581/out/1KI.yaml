book_intro: This and the following Book are called by the holy fathers the third and
  fourth book of Kings; but by the Hebrews, the first and second. They contain the
  history of the kingdoms of Israel and Juda, from the beginning of the reign of Solomon,
  to the captivity. As to the writer of these books, it seems most probable they were
  not written by one man; nor at one time; but as there was all along a succession
  of prophets in Israel, who recorded, by divine inspiration, the most remarkable
  things that happened in their days, these books seem to have been written by these
  prophets. See 2 Paralip. alias 2 Chron. 9.29; 12.15; 13.22; 20.34; 26.22; 32.32.

    verses:
      - ~
      - 'Now king David was old, and advanced in years: and when he was covered with
        clothes he was not warm.'
      - 'His servants therefore, said to him: Let us seek for our lord the king, a
        young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and cherish him, and sleep
        in his bosom and warm our lord the king.'
      - So they sought a beautiful young woman, in all the coasts of Israel and they
        found Abisag, a Sunamitess, and brought her to the king.
      - And the damsel was exceedingly beautiful, and she slept with the king, and
        served him, but the king did not know her.
      - 'And Adonias, the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying: I will be king.
        And he made himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.'
      - 'Neither did his father rebuke him at any time, saying: Why hast thou done
        this? And he also was very beautiful, the next in birth after Absalom.'
      - And he conferred with Joab, the son of Sarvia, and with Abiathar, the priest,
        who furthered Adonias’s side.
      - But Sadoc, the priest, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and Nathan, the prophet,
        and Semei, and Rei, and the strength of David’s army, was not with Adonias.
      - 'And Adonias having slain rams and calves, and all fat cattle, by the stone
        of Zoheleth, which was near the fountain Rogel, invited all his brethren,
        the king’s sons, and all the men of Juda, the king’s servants:'
      - But Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias, and all the valiant men, and Solomon,
        his brother, he invited not.
      - 'And Nathan said to Bethsabee, the mother of Solomon: Hast thou not heard
        that Adonias, the son of Haggith, reigneth, and our lord David knoweth it
        not?'
      - Now then, come, take my counsel, and save thy life, and the life of thy son
        Solomon.
      - 'Go, and get thee in to king David, and say to him: Didst not thou, my lord,
        O king, swear to me, thy handmaid, saying: Solomon, thy son, shall reign after
        me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then doth Adonias reign?'
      - And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I will come in after
        thee, and will fill up thy words.
      - So Bethsabee went in to the king into the chamber. Now the king was very old,
        and Abisag, the Sunamitess, ministered to him.
      - 'Bethsabee bowed herself, and worshipped the king. And the king said to her:
        What is thy will?'
      - 'She answered, and said: My lord, thou didst swear to thy handmaid, by the
        Lord thy God, saying: Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall
        sit on my throne.'
      - And behold, now Adonias reigneth, and thou, my lord the king, knowest nothing
        of it.
      - 'He hath killed oxen, and all fat cattle, and many rams, and invited all the
        king’s sons, and Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the general of the army:
        but Solomon, thy servant, he invited not.'
      - And now, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou
        shouldst tell them, who shall sit on thy throne, my lord the king, after thee.
      - Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king sleepeth with his fathers,
        that I, and my son, Solomon, shall be accounted offenders.
      - As she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan, the prophet, came.
      - 'And they told the king, saying: Nathan, the prophet, is here. And when he
        was come in before the king, and had worshipped, bowing down to the ground,'
      - 'Nathan said: My lord, O king, hast thou said: Let Adonias reign after me,
        and let him sit upon my throne?'
      - 'Because he is gone down to day, and hath killed oxen, and fatlings, and many
        rams, and invited all the king’s sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar
        the priest: and they are eating and drinking before him, and saying: God save
        king Adonias:'
      - But me, thy servant, and Sadoc, the priest, and Banaias, the son of Joiada,
        and Solomon, thy servant, he hath not invited.
      - Is this word come out from my lord the king, and hast thou not told me, thy
        servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
      - 'And king David answered, and said: Call to me Bethsabee. And when she was
        come in to the king, and stood before him,'
      - 'The king swore, and said: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul
        out of all distress,'
      - 'Even as I swore to thee, by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: Solomon
        thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead,
        so will I do this day.'
      - 'And Bethsabee, bowing with her face to the earth, worshipped the king, saying:
        May my lord David live for ever.'
      - 'King David also said: Call me Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet,
        and Banaias, the son of Joiada. And when they were come in before the king,'
      - 'He said to them: Take with you the servants of your lord, and set my son
        Solomon upon my mule: and bring him to Gihon:'
      - 'And let Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, anoint him there king
        over Israel: and you shall sound the trumpet, and shall say: God save king
        Solomon.'
      - 'And you shall come up after him, and he shall come, and shall sit upon my
        throne, and he shall reign in my stead: and I will appoint him to be ruler
        over Israel, and over Juda.'
      - 'And Banaias, the son of Joiada, answered the king, saying: Amen: so say the
        Lord, the God of my lord the king.'
      - As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, so be he with Solomon, and make
        his throne higher than the throne of my lord king David.
      - 'So Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, went down, and Banaias, the
        son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and Phelethi: and they set Solomon upon the
        mule of king David, and brought him to Gihon.'
      - 'And Sadoc, the priest, took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed
        Solomon: and they sounded the trumpet, and all the people said: God save king
        Solomon.'
      - And all the multitude went up after him, and the people played with pipes,
        and rejoiced with a great joy, and the earth rang with the noise of their
        cry.
      - 'And Adonias, and all that were invited by him, heard it, and now the feast
        was at an end. Joab also, hearing the sound of the trumpet, said: What meaneth
        this noise of the city in an uproar?'
      - 'While he yet spoke, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, the priest, came: and
        Adonias said to him: Come in, because thou art a valiant man, and bringest
        good news.'
      - 'And Jonathan answered Adonias: Not so: for our lord, king David, hath appointed
        Solomon king;'
      - 'And hath sent with him Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias,
        the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and they have set him
        upon the king’s mule:'
      - 'And Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, have anointed him king, in
        Gihon: and they are gone up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again:
        this is the noise that you have heard.'
      - Moreover, Solomon sitteth upon the throne of the kingdom.
      - 'And the king’s servants going in, have blessed our lord king David, saying:
        May God make the name of Solomon greater than thy name, and make his throne
        greater than thy throne. And the king adored in his bed:'
      - 'And he said: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who hath given this
        day one to sit on my throne, my eyes seeing it.'
      - Then all the guests of Adonias were afraid, and they all arose, and every
        man went his way.
      - And Adonias fearing Solomon, arose and went, and took hold of the horn of
        the altar.
      - 'And they told Solomon, saying: Behold Adonias fearing king Solomon, hath
        taken hold of the horn of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon swear to me
        this day, that he will not kill his servant with the sword.'
      - 'And Solomon said: If he be a good man, there shall not so much as one hair
        of his head fall to the ground: but if evil be found in him, he shall die.'
      - 'Then king Solomon sent, and brought him out from the altar: and going in,
        he worshipped king Solomon: and Solomon said to him: Go to thy house.'

      is put to death: Abiathar is banished: Joab and Semei are slain.'

        instances:
          - note: These instructions given by David to his son, with relation to Joab
              and Semei, proceeded not from any rancour of heart, or private pique;
              but from a zeal for justice, that crimes so public and heinous might
              not pass unpunished.

              but the place and state of the dead.
            quote: To hell
    verses:
      - ~
      - 'And the days of David drew nigh that he should die, and he charged his son
        Solomon, saying:'
      - 'I am going the way of all flesh: take thou courage and shew thyself a man.'
      - 'And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and observe
        his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies, as it is
        written in the law of Moses: that thou mayst understand all thou dost, and
        whithersoever thou shalt turn thyself:'
      - 'That the Lord may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me, saying:
        If thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk before me in
        truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, there shall not be taken
        away from thee a man on the throne of Israel.'
      - 'Thou knowest also what Joab, the son of Sarvia, hath done to me, what he
        did to the two captains of the army of Israel, to Abner, the son of Ner, and
        to Amasa, the son of Jether: whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace,
        and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his
        shoes that were on his feet.'
      - Do, therefore, according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down
        to hell in peace.
      - 'But shew kindness to the sons of Berzellai, the Galaadite, and let them eat
        at thy table: for they met me when I fled from the face of Absalom, thy brother.'
      - 'Thou hast also with thee Semei, the son of Gera, the son of Jemini, of Bahurim,
        who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went to the camp: but because
        he came down to meet me when I passed over the Jordan, and I swore to him
        by the Lord, saying: I will not kill thee with the sword:'
      - Do not thou hold him guiltless. But thou art a wise man, and knowest what
        to do with him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to the
        grave.
      - So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
      - 'And the days that David reigned in Israel, were forty years: in Hebron he
        reigned seven years, in Jerusalem thirty-three.'
      - And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was strengthened
        exceedingly.
      - 'And Adonias, the son of Haggith, came to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon.
        And she said to him: Is thy coming peaceable? He answered: It is peaceable.'
      - 'And he added: I have a word to speak with thee. She said to him: Speak. And
        he said:'
      - 'Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had preferred me to
        be their king: but the kingdom is transferred, and is become my brother’s:
        for it was appointed him by the Lord.'
      - 'Now therefore, I ask one petition of thee; turn not away my face. And she
        said to him: Say on.'
      - And he said I pray thee speak to king Solomon (for he cannot deny thee any
        thing) to give me Abisag, the Sunamitess, to wife.
      - 'And Bethsabee said: Well, I will speak for thee to the king.'
      - 'Then Bethsabee came to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonias: and the
        king arose to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat down upon his throne: and
        a throne was set for the king’s mother, and she sat on his right hand.'
      - 'And she said to him: I desire one small petition of thee; do not put me to
        confusion. And the king said to her: My mother ask, for I must not turn away
        thy face.'
      - 'And she said: Let Abisag, the Sunamitess, be given to Adonias, thy brother,
        to wife.'
      - 'And king Solomon answered, and said to his mother: Why dost thou ask Abisag,
        the Sunamitess, for Adonias? ask for him also the kingdom; for he is my elder
        brother, and hath Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the son of Sarvia.'
      - 'Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: So and so may God do to me,
        and add more, if Adonias hath not spoken this word against his own life.'
      - And now, as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and placed me upon the
        throne of David, my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised,
        Adonias shall be put to death this day.
      - And king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaias, the son of Joiada, who slew
        him, and he died.
      - 'And the king said also to Abiathar, the priest: Go to Anathoth, to thy lands,
        for indeed thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee
        to death, because thou didst carry the ark of the Lord God before David, my
        father, and hast endured trouble in all the troubles my father endured.'
      - So Solomon cast out Abiathar from being the priest of the Lord, that the word
        of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Heli
        in Silo.
      - 'And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after Adonias, and had
        not turned after Solomon: and Joab fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and
        took hold on the horn of the altar.'
      - 'And it was told king Solomon, that Joab was fled into the tabernacle of the
        Lord, and was by the altar: and Solomon sent Banaias, the son of Joiada, saying.
        Go, kill him.'
      - 'And Banaias came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him: Thus saith
        the king: Come forth. And he said: I will not come forth, but here I will
        die. Banaias brought word back to the king, saying: Thus saith Joab, and thus
        he answered me.'
      - 'And the king said to him: Do as he hath said; and kill him, and bury him,
        and thou shalt remove the innocent blood which hath been shed by Joab, from
        me, and from the house of my father:'
      - 'And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head; because he murdered
        two men, just and better than himself: and slew them with the sword, my father,
        David, not knowing it; Abner, the son of Ner, general of the army of Israel,
        and Amasa, the son of Jether general of the army of Juda;'
      - And their blood shall return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his
        seed for ever. But to David and his seed, and his house, and to his throne,
        be peace for ever from the Lord.
      - So Banaias, the son of Joiada, went up, and setting upon him slew him, and
        he was buried in his house in the desert.
      - And the king appointed Banaias, the son of Joiada in his room over the army;
        and Sadoc, the priest, he put in the place of Abiathar.
      - 'The king also sent, and called for Semei, and said to him: Build thee a house
        in Jerusalem, and dwell there: and go not out from thence any where.'
      - 'For on what day soever thou shalt go out, and shalt pass over the brook Cedron,
        know that thou shalt be put to death: thy blood shall be upon thy own head.'
      - 'And Semei said to the king: The saying is good: as my lord the king hath
        said, so will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.'
      - 'And it came to pass after three years, that the servants of Semei ran away
        to Achis, the son of Maacha, the king of Geth: and it was told Semei that
        his servants were gone to Geth.'
      - And Semei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Achis, to Geth, to seek
        his servants, and he brought them out of Geth.
      - And it was told Solomon, that Semei had gone from Jerusalem to Geth, and was
        come back.
      - 'And sending he called for him, and said to him: Did I not protest to thee
        by the Lord, and tell thee before: On what day soever thou shalt go out and
        walk abroad any where, know that thou shalt die? And thou answeredst me: The
        word that I have heard is good.'
      - Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment that
        I laid upon thee?
      - 'And the king said to Semei: Thou knowest all the evil, of which thy heart
        is conscious, which thou didst to David, my father: the Lord hath returned
        thy wickedness upon thy own head.'
      - And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established
        before the Lord for ever.
      - 'So the king commanded Banaias, the son of Joiada: and he went out and struck
        him; and he died.'
  - chapter_intro: 'Solomon marrieth Pharao’s daughter. He sacrificeth in Gabaon:
      in the choice which God gave him he preferreth wisdom. His wise judgment between
      the two harlots.'

              to the ordinance of the law; which allowed of no other places for sacrifice
              but the temple of God. Among these high places that of Gabaon was the
              chiefest, because there was the tabernacle of the testimony, which had
              been removed from Silo to Nobe and from Nobe to Gabaon.
            quote: High places
    verses:
      - ~
      - 'And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon, and he made affinity
        with Pharao, the king of Egypt: for he took his daughter, and brought her
        into the city of David: until he had made an end of building his own house,
        and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.'
      - 'But yet the people sacrificed in the high places: for there was no temple
        built to the name of the Lord until that day.'
      - And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the precepts of David, his father;
        only he sacrificed in the high places, and burnt incense.
      - 'He went therefore to Gabaon, to sacrifice there: for that was the great high
        place: a thousand victims for holocausts, did Solomon offer upon that altar,
        in Gabaon.'
      - 'And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, saying: Ask what thou
        wilt that I should give thee.'
      - 'And Solomon said: Thou hast shewed great mercy to thy servant David, my father,
        even as he walked before thee in truth, and justice, and an upright heart
        with thee: and thou hast kept thy great mercy for him, and hast given him
        a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.'
      - 'And now, O Lord God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David, my
        father: and I am but a child, and know not how to go out and come in;'
      - And thy servant is in the midst of the people which thou hast chosen, an immense
        people, which cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
      - Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy people,
        and discern between good and evil. For who shall be able to judge this people,
        thy people, which is so numerous?
      - And the word was pleasing to the Lord, that Solomon had asked such a thing.
      - 'And the Lord said to Solomon: Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast
        not asked for thyself long life nor riches, nor the lives of thy enemies,
        but hast asked for thyself wisdom to discern judgment;'
      - Behold I have done for thee according to thy words, and have given thee a
        wise and understanding heart, in so much that there hath been no one like
        thee before thee, nor shall arise after thee.
      - 'Yea, and the things also which thou didst not ask, I have given thee; to
        wit, riches and glory: so that no one hath been like thee among the kings
        in all days heretofore.'
      - And if thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my precepts and my commandments,
        as thy father walked, I will lengthen thy days.
      - 'And Solomon awaked, and perceived that it was a dream: and when he was come
        to Jerusalem, he stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered
        holocausts, and sacrificed victims of peace offerings, and made a great feast
        for all his servants.'
      - Then there came two women that were harlots, to the king, and stood before
        him.
      - 'And one of them said: I beseech thee, my lord, I and this woman dwelt in
        one house, and I was delivered of a child with her in the chamber.'
      - And the third day after I was delivered, she also was delivered; and we were
        together, and no other person with us in the house; only we two.
      - 'And this woman’s child died in the night: for in her sleep she overlaid him.'
      - 'And rising in the dead time of the night, she took my child from my side,
        while I, thy handmaid, was asleep, and laid it in her bosom: and laid her
        dead child in my bosom.'
      - 'And when I arose in the morning, to give my child suck, behold it was dead:
        but considering him more diligently, when it was clear day, I found that it
        was not mine which I bore.'
      - 'And the other woman answered: It is not so as thou sayest, but thy child
        is dead, and mine is alive. On the contrary, she said; Thou liest: for my
        child liveth, and thy child is dead. And in this manner they strove before
        the king.'
      - 'Then said the king: The one saith, My child is alive, and thy child is dead.
        And the other answereth: Nay; but thy child is dead, and mine liveth.'
      - 'The king therefore said: Bring me a sword. And when they had brought a sword
        before the king,'
      - Divide, said he, the living child in two, and give half to the one and half
        to the other.
      - 'But the woman, whose child was alive, said to the king; (for her bowels were
        moved upon her child) I beseech thee, my lord, give her the child alive, and
        do not kill it. But the other said: Let it be neither mine nor thine; but
        divide it.'
      - 'The king answered, and said: Give the living child to this woman, and let
        it not be killed; for she is the mother thereof.'
      - And all Israel heard the judgment which the king had judged, and they feared
        the king, seeing that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment.

      - 'And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent his servants to Solomon: for he heard that
        they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram had always
        been David’s friend.'
      - 'And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:'
      - Thou knowest the will of David, my father, and that he could not build a house
        to the name of the Lord his God, because of the wars that were round about
        him, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.
      - But now the Lord my God hath given me rest round about; and there is no adversary
        nor evil occurrence.
      - 'Wherefore I purpose to build a temple to the name of the Lord my God, as
        the Lord spoke to David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will set upon the
        throne, in thy place, he shall build a house to my name.'
      - 'Give orders, therefore, that thy servants cut me down cedar trees, out of
        Libanus, and let my servants be with thy servants: and I will give thee the
        hire of thy servants whatsoever thou wilt ask: for thou knowest how there
        is not among my people a man that has skill to hew wood like to the Sidonians.'
      - 'Now when Hiram had heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced exceedingly, and
        said: Blessed be the Lord God this day, who hath given to David a very wise
        son over this numerous people.'
      - 'And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: I have heard all thou hast desired of
        me; and I will do all thy desire concerning cedar trees, and fir trees.'
      - 'My servants shall bring them down from Libanus to the sea: and I will put
        them together in floats, on the sea, and convey them to the place, which thou
        shalt signify to me, and will land them there, and thou shalt receive them:
        and thou shalt allow me necessaries to furnish food for my household.'
      - So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees, and fir trees, according to all his desire.
      - 'And Solomon allowed Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat, for provision
        for his house, and twenty measures of the purest oil: thus gave Solomon to
        Hiram every year.'
      - 'And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon, as he promised him: and there was peace
        between Hiram and Solomon, and they two made a league together.'
      - And king Solomon chose workmen out of all Israel, and the levy was of thirty
        thousand men.
      - 'And he sent them to Libanus, ten thousand every month, by turns, so that
        two months they were at home: and Adoniram was over this levy.'

      - And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children
        of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of the reign of
        Solomon over Israel, in the month Zio, (the same is the second month) he began
        to build a house to the Lord.
      - And the house, which king Solomon built to the Lord, was threescore cubits
        in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and thirty cubits in height.
      - 'And there was a porch before the temple, of twenty cubits in length, according
        to the measure of the breadth of the temple: and it was ten cubits in breadth,
        before the face of the temple.'
      - And he made in the temple oblique windows.
      - And upon the wall of the temple, he built floors round about, in the walls
        of the house, round about the temple and the oracle, and he made chambers
        in the sides round about.
      - The floor that was underneath was five cubits in breadth, and the middle floor
        was six cubits in breadth, and the third floor was seven cubits in breadth.
        And he put beams in the house round about on the outside, that they might
        not be fastened in the walls of the temple.
      - 'And the house, when it was in building, was built of stones, hewed and made
        ready: so that there was neither hammer nor axe, nor any tool of iron heard
        in the house when it was in building.'
      - 'The door, for the middle side, was on the right hand of the house: and by
        winding stairs they went up to the middle room, and from the middle to the
        third.'
      - 'So he built the house, and finished it: and he covered the house with roofs
        of cedar.'
      - And he built a floor over all the house, five cubits in height, and he covered
        the house with timber of cedar.
      - 'And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying:'
      - As for this house, which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes,
        and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments, walking in them, I
        will fulfil my word to thee, which I spoke to David thy father.
      - And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and I will not forsake
        my people Israel.
      - So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
      - 'And he built the walls of the house on the inside, with boards of cedar,
        from the floor of the house to the top of the walls, and to the roofs, he
        covered it with boards of cedar on the inside: and he covered the floor of
        the house with planks of fir.'
      - 'And he built up twenty cubits with boards of cedar at the hinder part of
        the temple, from the floor to the top: and made the inner house of the oracle
        to be the holy of holies.'
      - And the temple itself, before the doors of the oracle, was forty cubits long.
      - 'And all the house was covered within with cedar, having the turnings, and
        the joints thereof artfully wrought, and carvings projecting out: all was
        covered with boards of cedar: and no stone could be seen in the wall at all.'
      - And he made the oracle in the midst of the house, in the inner part, to set
        there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
      - Now the oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth,
        and twenty cubits in height. And he covered it, and overlaid it with most
        pure gold. And the altar also he covered with cedar.
      - And the house before the oracle he overlaid with most pure gold, and fastened
        on the plates with nails of gold.
      - 'And there was nothing in the temple that was not covered with gold: the whole
        altar of the oracle he covered also with gold.'
      - And he made in the oracle two cherubims of olive tree, of ten cubits in height.
      - 'One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub
        was five cubits: that is, in all ten cubits, from the extremity of one wing
        to the extremity of the other wing.'
      - 'The second cherub also was ten cubits: and the measure, and the work was
        the same in both the cherubims:'
      - That is to say, one cherub was ten cubits high, and in like manner the other
        cherub.
      - 'And he set the cherubims in the midst of the inner temple: and the cherubims
        stretched forth their wings, and the wing of the one touched one wall, and
        the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall: and the other wings in
        the midst of the temple touched one another.'
      - And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
      - 'And all the walls of the temple round about he carved with divers figures
        and carvings: and he made in them cherubims and palm trees, and divers representations,
        as it were standing out, and coming forth from the wall.'
      - And the floor of the house he also overlaid with gold within and without.
      - And in the entrance of the oracle, he made little doors of olive tree, and
        posts of five corners,
      - 'And two doors of olive tree: and he carved upon them figures of cherubims,
        and figures of palm trees, and carvings very much projecting; and he overlaid
        them with gold: and he covered both the cherubims and the palm trees, and
        the other things, with gold.'
      - 'And he made in the entrance of the temple posts of olive tree foursquare:'
      - 'And two doors of fir tree, one of each side: and each door was double, and
        so opened with folding leaves.'
      - 'And he carved cherubims, and palm trees, and carved work standing very much
        out: and he overlaid all with golden plates in square work by rule.'
      - And he built the inner court with three rows of polished stones, and one row
        of beams of cedar.
      - 'In the fourth year was the house of the Lord founded, in the month Zio:'
      - 'And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul. (which is the eighth month) the

        thereof: and he was seven years in building it.'

        hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits, and the height thirty cubits:
        and four galleries between pillars of cedar: for he had cut cedar trees into
        pillars.'
      - And he covered the whole vault with boards of cedar, and it was held up with
        five and forty pillars. And one row had fifteen pillars,
      - Set one against another,
      - And looking one upon another, with equal space between the pillars, and over
        the pillars were square beams in all things equal.
      - 'And he made a porch of pillars of fifty cubits in length, and thirty cubits
        in breadth: and another porch before the greater porch, and pillars, and chapiters
        upon the pillars.'
      - He made also the porch of the throne wherein is the seat of judgment; and
        covered it with cedar wood from the floor to the top.
      - And in the midst of the porch, was a small house, where he sat in judgment
        of the like work. He made also a house for the daughter of Pharao (whom Solomon
        had taken to wife) of the same work, as this porch;
      - 'All of costly stones, which were sawed by a certain rule and measure, both
        within and without: from the foundation to the top of the walls, and without,
        unto the great court.'
      - And the foundations were of costly stones, great stones of ten cubits or eight
        cubits.
      - And above there were costly stones of equal measure hewed, and in like manner
        planks of cedar.
      - And the great court was made round with three rows of hewed stones, and one
        row of planks of cedar, which also was observed in the inner court of the
        house of the Lord, and in the porch of the house.
      - And king Solomon sent, and brought Hiram from Tyre,
      - The son of a widow woman, of the tribe of Nephthali, whose father was a Tyrian,
        an artificer in brass, and full of wisdom, and understanding, and skill to
        work all work in brass. And when he was come to king Solomon, he wrought all
        his work.
      - 'And he cast two pillars in brass, each pillar was eighteen cubits high: and
        a line of twelve cubits compassed both the pillars.'
      - 'He made also two chapiters of molten brass, to be set upon the tops of the
        pillars: the height of one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the
        other chapiter was five cubits:'
      - 'And a kind of network, and chain work wreathed together with wonderful art.
        Both the chapiters of the pillars were cast: seven rows of nets were on one
        chapiter, and seven nets on the other chapiter.'
      - 'And he made the pillars, and two rows round about each network to cover the
        chapiters, that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and in like manner did
        he to the other chapiter.'
      - And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars, were of lily work,
        in the porch of four cubits.
      - 'And again there were other chapiters on the top of the pillars above, according
        to the measure of the pillar over against the network: and of pomegranates
        there were two hundred, in rows round about the other chapiter.'
      - 'And he set up the two pillars in the porch of the temple: and when he had
        set up the pillar on the right hand, he called the name thereof Jachin: in
        like manner he set up the second pillar, and called the name thereof Booz.'
      - 'And upon the tops of the pillars he made lily work: so the work of the pillars
        was finished.'
      - He made also a molten sea, of ten cubits, from brim to brim, round all about;
        the height of it was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits compassed it
        round about.
      - 'And a graven work, under the brim of it, compassed it for ten cubits going
        about the sea: there were two rows cast of chamfered sculptures.'
      - 'And it stood upon twelve oxen, of which three looked towards the north, and
        three towards the west, and three towards the south, and three towards the
        east: and the sea was above upon them, and their hinder parts were all hid
        within.'
      - 'And the laver was a hand breadth thick: and the brim thereof was like the
        brim of a cup, or the leaf of a crisped lily: it contained two thousand bates.'
      - And he made ten bases of brass, every base was four cubits in length, and
        four cubits in breadth, and three cubits high.
      - 'And the work itself of the bases, was intergraven: and there were gravings
        between the joinings.'
      - 'And between the little crowns and the ledges, were lions, and oxen, and cherubims;
        and in the joinings likewise above: and under the lions and oxen, as it were
        bands of brass hanging down.'
      - 'And every base had four wheels, and axletrees of brass: and at the four sides
        were undersetters, under the laver molten, looking one against another.'
      - 'The mouth also of the laver within, was in the top of the chapiter: and that
        which appeared without, was of one cubit all round, and together it was one
        cubit and a half: and in the corners of the pillars were divers engravings:
        and the spaces between the pillars were square, not round.'
      - 'And the four wheels, which were at the four corners of the base, were joined
        one to another under the base: the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.'
      - 'And they were such wheels as are used to be made in a chariot: and their
        axletrees, and spokes, and strakes, and naves, were all cast.'
      - And the four undersetters, that were at every corner of each base, were of
        the base itself, cast and joined together.
      - And on the top of the base, there was a round compass of half a cubit, so
        wrought that the laver might be set thereon, having its gravings, and divers
        sculptures of itself.
      - He engraved also in those plates, which were of brass, and in the corners,
        cherubims, and lions, and palm trees, in likeness of a man standing, so that
        they seemed not to be engraven, but added round about.
      - After this manner, he made ten bases, of one casting and measure, and the
        like graving.
      - 'He made also ten lavers of brass: one laver contained four bases, and was
        of four cubits: and upon every base, in all ten, he put as many lavers.'
      - 'And he set the ten bases, five on the right side of the temple, and five
        on the left: and the sea he put on the right side of the temple, over against
        the east southward.'
      - And Hiram made cauldrons, and shovels, and basins, and finished all the work
        of king Solomon in the temple of the Lord.
      - 'The two pillars and the two cords of the chapiters, upon the chapiters of
        the pillars: and the two networks, to cover the two cords, that were upon
        the top of the pillars.'
      - 'And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks: two rows of pomegranates
        for each network, to cover the cords of the chapiters, which were upon the
        tops of the pillars.'
      - And the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases.
      - And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea.
      - And the cauldrons, and the shovels, and the basins. All the vessels that Hiram
        made for king Solomon, for the house of the Lord, were of fine brass.
      - In the plains of the Jordan, did the king cast them in a clay ground, between
        Socoth and Sartham.
      - 'And Solomon placed all the vessels: but for its exceeding great multitude
        the brass could not be weighed.'
      - 'And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of the Lord: the altar of
        gold, and the table of gold, upon which the loaves of proposition should be
        set:'
      - 'And the golden candlesticks, five on the right hand, and five on the left,
        over against the oracle, of pure gold: and the flowers like lilies, and the
        lamps over them of gold: and golden snuffers,'
      - 'And pots, and fleshhooks, and bowls, and mortars, and censers, of most pure
        gold: and the hinges for the doors of the inner house of the holy of holies,
        and for the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.'
      - And Solomon finished all the work that he made in the house of the Lord, and
        brought in the things that David, his father, had dedicated, the silver and
        the gold, and the vessels, and laid them up in the treasures of the house
        of the Lord.

        in Jerusalem: that they might carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, out
        of the city of David, that is, out of Sion.'
      - And all Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon, on the festival day,
        in the month of Ethanim, the same is the seventh month.
      - And all the ancients of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark,
      - 'And carried the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the covenant, and
        all the vessels of the sanctuary, that were in the tabernacle: and the priests
        and the Levites carried them.'
      - And king Solomon, and all the multitude of Israel, that were assembled unto
        him, went with him before the ark, and they sacrificed sheep and oxen, that
        could not be counted or numbered.
      - And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place,
        into the oracle of the temple, into the holy of holies, under the wings of
        the cherubims.
      - For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and
        covered the ark, and the staves thereof above.
      - And whereas the staves stood out, the ends of them were seen without, in the
        sanctuary before the oracle, but were not seen farther out, and there they
        have been unto this day.
      - Now in the ark there was nothing else but the two tables of stone, which Moses
        put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel,
        when they came out of the land of Egypt.
      - And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the sanctuary, that

        out of all the tribes of Israel, for a house to be built, that my name might
        be there: but I chose David to be over my people Israel.'
      - 'And David, my father, would have built a house to the name of the Lord, the
        God of Israel:'

        heart to build a house to my name, thou hast done well in having this same
        thing in thy mind.'
      - Nevertheless, thou shalt not build me a house, but thy son, that shall come
        forth out of thy loins, he shall build a house to my name.
      - 'The Lord hath performed his word which he spoke. And I stand in the room
        of David, my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised:
        and have built a house to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.'
      - And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord,
        which he made with our fathers, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
      - And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord, in the sight of the assembly
        of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heaven,
      - 'And said: Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above,
        or on the earth beneath: who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants,
        that have walked before thee with all their heart:'
      - 'Who hast kept with thy servant David, my father, what thou hast promised

        a man in my sight, to sit on the throne of Israel: yet so that thy children
        take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked in my
        sight.'
      - And now, Lord God of Israel, let thy words be established, which thou hast
        spoken to thy servant David, my father.
      - Is it then to be thought that God should indeed dwell upon earth? for if heaven,
        and the heavens of heavens, cannot contain thee, how much less this house
        which I have built?
      - 'But have regard to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, O
        Lord, my God: hear the hymn and the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before
        thee this day:'
      - 'That thy eyes may be open upon this house, night and day: upon the house
        of which thou hast said: My name shall be there: that thou mayst hearken to
        the prayer which thy servant prayeth, in this place to thee:'
      - That thou mayst hearken to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people
        Israel, whatsoever they shall pray for in this place, and hear them in the
        place of thy dwelling in heaven; and when thou hearest, shew them mercy.
      - If any man trespass against his neighbour, and have an oath upon him, wherewith
        he is bound, and come, because of the oath, before thy altar, to thy house,
      - 'Then hear thou in heaven: and do and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked,
        and bringing his way upon his own head, and justifying the just, and rewarding
        him according to his justice.'
      - 'If thy people Israel shall fly before their enemies (because they will sin
        against thee) and doing penance, and confessing to thy name, shall come and
        pray, and make supplications to thee in this house:'
      - Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring
        them back to the land which thou gavest to their fathers.
      - 'If heaven shall be shut up, and there shall be no rain, because of their
        sins, and they, praying in this place, shall do penance to thy name, and shall
        be converted from their sins, by occasion of their afflictions:'
      - 'Then hear thou them in heaven, and forgive the sins of thy servants, and
        of thy people Israel: and shew them the good way wherein they should walk,
        and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people in possession.'
      - If a famine arise in the land, or a pestilence, or corrupt air, or blasting,
        or locust, or mildew; if their enemy afflict them, besieging the gates, whatsoever
        plague, whatsoever infirmity,
      - 'Whatsoever curse or imprecation shall happen to any man of thy people Israel:
        when a man shall know the wound of his own heart, and shall spread forth his
        hands in this house;'
      - Then hear thou in heaven, in the place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and do
        so as to give to every one according to his ways, as thou shalt see his heart
        (for thou only knowest the heart of all the children of men)
      - That they may fear thee all the days that they live upon the face of the land,
        which thou hast given to our fathers.
      - Moreover also the stranger, who is not of thy people Israel, when he shall
        come out of a far country for thy name’s sake, (for they shall hear every
        where of thy great name, and thy mighty hand,
      - And thy stretched out arm) so when he shall come, and shall pray in this place,
      - 'Then hear thou in heaven, in the firmament of thy dwelling place, and do
        all those things, for which that stranger shall call upon thee: that all the
        people of the earth may learn to fear thy name, as do thy people Israel, and
        may prove that thy name is called upon on this house, which I have built.'
      - 'If thy people go out to war against their enemies, by what way soever thou
        shalt send them, they shall pray to thee towards the way of the city, which
        thou hast chosen, and towards the house, which I have built to thy name:'
      - And then hear thou in heaven their prayers, and their supplications, and do
        judgment for them.
      - But if they sin against thee, (for there is no man who sinneth not) and thou
        being angry, deliver them up to their enemies, so that they be led away captives
        into the land of their enemies, far or near;
      - 'Then if they do penance in their heart, in the place of captivity, and being
        converted, make supplication to thee in their captivity, saying: We have sinned,
        we have done unjustly, we have committed wickedness:'
      - 'And return to thee with all their heart, and all their soul, in the land
        of their enemies, to which they have been led captives: and pray to thee towards
        the way of their land, which thou gavest to their fathers, and of the city
        which thou hast chosen, and of the temple which I have built to thy name:'
      - 'Then hear thou in heaven, in the firmament of thy throne, their prayers,
        and their supplications, and do judgment for them:'
      - 'And forgive thy people, that have sinned against thee, and all their iniquities,
        by which they have transgressed against thee: and give them mercy before them
        that have made them captives, that they may have compassion on them.'
      - For they are thy people, and thy inheritance, whom thou hast brought out of
        the land of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron.
      - That thy eyes may be open to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people
        Israel, to hear them in all things for which they shall call upon thee.
      - For thou hast separated them to thyself for an inheritance, from amongst all
        the people of the earth, as thou hast spoken by Moses, thy servant, when thou
        broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.
      - 'And it came to pass, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer
        and supplication to the Lord, that he rose from before the altar of the Lord:
        for he had fixed both knees on the ground, and had spread his hands towards
        heaven.'
      - 'And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying:'
      - 'Blessed be the Lord, who hath given rest to his people Israel, according
        to all that he promised: there hath not failed so much as one word of all
        the good things that he promised by his servant Moses.'
      - 'The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers, and not leave us,
        nor cast us off:'
      - But may he incline our hearts to himself, that we may walk in all his ways,
        and keep his commandments, and his ceremonies, and all his judgments, which
        he commanded our fathers.
      - 'And let these my words, wherewith I have prayed before the Lord, be nigh
        unto the Lord our God day and night, that he may do judgment for his servant,
        and for his people Israel, day by day:'
      - That all the people of the earth may know, that the Lord he is God, and there
        is no other besides him.
      - Let our hearts also be perfect with the Lord our God, that we may walk in
        his statutes, and keep his commandments, as at this day.
      - And the king, and all Israel with him, offered victims before the Lord.
      - And Solomon slew victims of peace offerings, which he sacrificed to the Lord,
        two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the
        king, and all the children of Israel, dedicated the temple of the Lord.
      - 'In that day the king sanctified the middle of the court, that was before
        the house of the Lord for there he offered the holocaust, and sacrifice, and
        the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the
        Lord, was too little to receive the holocaust, and sacrifice, and the fat
        of the peace offerings.'
      - And Solomon made at the same time a solemn feast, and all Israel with him,
        a great multitude, from the entrance of Emath to the river of Egypt, before
        the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, that is, fourteen days.
      - 'And on the eighth day, he sent away the people: and they blessed the king,
        and went to their dwellings, rejoicing, and glad in heart, for all the good
        things that the Lord had done for David, his servant, and for Israel, his
        people.'

      - That the Lord appeared to him the second time, as he had appeared to him in
        Gabaon.
      - 'And the Lord said to him: I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, which
        thou hast made before me: I have sanctified this house, which thou hast built,

        and will not keep my commandments, and my ceremonies, which I have set before
        you, but will go and worship strange gods, and adore them:'
      - I will take away Israel from the face of the land which I have given them;
        and the temple which I have sanctified to my name, I will cast out of my sight;
        and Israel shall be a proverb, and a byword among all people.
      - 'And this house shall be made an example of: every one that shall pass by
        it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss, and say: Why hath the Lord done thus
        to this land, and to this house?'
      - 'And they shall answer: Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought
        their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and followed strange gods, and adored
        them, and worshipped them: therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this
        evil.'
      - And when twenty years were ended, after Solomon had built the two houses;
        that is, the house of the Lord, and the house of the king,
      - (Hiram, the king of Tyre, furnishing Solomon with cedar trees, and fir trees,
        and gold, according to all he had need of) then Solomon gave Hiram twenty
        cities in the land of Galilee.
      - And Hiram came out of Tyre, to see the towns which Solomon had given him,
        and they pleased him not;
      - 'And he said: Are these the cities which thou hast given me, brother? And
        he called them the land of Chabul, unto this day.'
      - And Hiram sent to king Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold.
      - This is the sum of the expenses, which king Solomon offered to build the house
        of the Lord, and his own house, and Mello, and the wall of Jerusalem, and
        Heser, and Mageddo, and Gazer.
      - 'Pharao, the king of Egypt, came up and took Gazer, and burnt it with fire:
        and slew the Chanaanite that dwelt in the city, and gave it for a dowry to
        his daughter, Solomon’s wife.'
      - So Solomon built Gazer, and Bethhoron the nether,
      - And Baalath, and Palmira, in the land of the wilderness.
      - And all the towns that belonged to himself, and were not walled, he fortified;
        the cities also of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen, and whatsoever
        he had a mind to build in Jerusalem, and in Libanus, and in all the land of
        his dominion.
      - 'All the people that were left of the Amorrhites, and Hethites, and Pherezites,

      - Their children, that were left in the land; to wit, such as the children of
        Israel had not been able to destroy, Solomon made tributary unto this day.
      - But of the children of Israel, Solomon made not any to be bondmen, but they
        were warriors, and his servants, and his princes, and captains, and overseers
        of the chariots and horses.
      - And there were five hundred and fifty chief officers set over all the works
        of Solomon, and they had people under them, and had charge over the appointed
        works.
      - 'And the daughter of Pharao came up out of the city of David to her house,

        offerings, upon the altar which he had built to the Lord, and he burnt incense

        of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
      - And Hiram sent his servants in the fleet, sailors that had knowledge of the

      - And the queen of Saba having heard of the fame of Solomon in the name of the
        Lord, came to try him with hard questions.
      - And entering into Jerusalem with a great train, and riches, and camels that
        carried spices, and an immense quantity of gold, and precious stones, she
        came to king Solomon, and spoke to him all that she had in her heart.
      - 'And Solomon informed her of all the things she proposed to him: there was
        not any word the king was ignorant of, and which he could not answer her.'
      - And when the queen of Saba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which
        he had built,
      - And the meat of his table, and the apartments of his servants, and the order
        of his ministers, and their apparel, and the cupbearers, and the holocausts,
        which he offered in the house of the Lord, she had no longer any spirit in
        her;
      - 'And she said to the king: The report is true, which I heard in my own country,'
      - 'Concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom. And I did not believe them
        that told me, till I came myself, and saw with my own eyes, and have found
        that the half hath not been told me: thy wisdom and thy works exceed the fame
        which I heard.'
      - Blessed are thy men, and blessed are thy servants, who stand before thee always,
        and hear thy wisdom.
      - Blessed be the Lord thy God, whom thou hast pleased, and who hath set thee
        upon the throne of Israel, because the Lord hath loved Israel for ever, and
        hath appointed thee king, to do judgment and justice.
      - 'And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices
        a very great store, and precious stones: there was brought no more such abundance
        of spices as these which the queen of Saba gave to king Solomon.'
      - (The navy also of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir
        great plenty of thyine trees, and precious stones.
      - 'And the king made of the thyine trees the rails of the house of the Lord,
        and of the king’s house: and citterns and harps for singers: there were no
        such thyine trees as these brought nor seen unto this day.)'
      - 'And king Solomon gave the queen of Saba all that she desired, and asked of
        him: besides what he offered her of himself of his royal bounty. And she returned,
        and went to her own country, with her servants.'
      - 'And the weight of the gold that was brought to Solomon every year, was six
        hundred and sixty-six talents of gold:'

      - 'And Solomon made two hundred shields of the purest gold: he allowed six hundred
        sicles of gold for the plates of one shield.'
      - 'And three hundred targets of fine gold: three hundred pounds of gold covered
        one target: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Libanus.'
      - 'King Solomon also made a great throne of ivory: and overlaid it with the
        finest gold.'
      - 'It had six steps: and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were
        two hands on either side holding the seat: and two lions stood, one at each
        hand,'
      - 'And twelve little lions stood upon the six steps, on the one side and on
        the other: there was no such work made in any kingdom.'
      - 'Moreover, all the vessels out of which king Solomon drank, were of gold:
        and all the furniture of the house of the forest of Libanus was of most pure
        gold: there was no silver, nor was any account made of it in the days of Solomon:'
      - For the king’s navy, once in three years, went with the navy of Hiram by sea
        to Tharsis, and brought from thence gold, and silver, and elephants’ teeth,
        and apes, and peacocks.
      - And king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
      - And all the earth desired to see Solomon’s face, to hear his wisdom, which
        God had given in his heart.
      - And every one brought him presents, vessels of silver and of gold, garments,
        and armour, and spices, and horses, and mules, every year.
      - 'And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand
        four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he bestowed them
        in fenced cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.'
      - 'And he made silver to be as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones: and cedars
        to be as common as sycamores which grow in the plains.'
      - 'And horses were brought for Solomon out of Egypt, and Coa: for the king’s
        merchants bought them out of Coa, and brought them at a set price.'
      - And a chariot of four horses came out of Egypt, for six hundred sicles of
        silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And after this manner did all

      - 'And king Solomon loved many strange women, besides the daughter of Pharao,
        and women of Moab, and of Ammon, and of Edom, and of Sidon, and of the Hethites:'
      - 'Of the nations concerning which the Lord said to the children of Israel:
        You shall not go in unto them, neither shall any of them come into yours:
        for they will most certainly turn away your hearts to follow their gods. And
        to these was Solomon joined with a most ardent love.'
      - 'And he had seven hundred wives as queens, and three hundred concubines: and
        the women turned away his heart.'
      - 'And when he was now old, his heart was turned away by women to follow strange
        gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart
        of David, his father.'
      - But Solomon worshipped Astarthe, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Moloch,
        the idol of the Ammonites.
      - And Solomon did that which was not pleasing before the Lord, and did not fully
        follow the Lord, as David, his father.
      - Then Solomon built a temple for Chamos, the idol of Moab, on the hill that
        is over against Jerusalem, and for Moloch, the idol of the children of Ammon.
      - And he did in this manner for all his wives that were strangers, who burnt
        incense, and offered sacrifice to their gods.
      - And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his mind was turned away from
        the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice;
      - 'And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not follow strange
        gods: but he kept not the things which the Lord commanded him.'
      - 'The Lord therefore said to Solomon: Because thou hast done this, and hast
        not kept my covenant, and my precepts, which I have commanded thee, I will
        divide and rend thy kingdom, and will give it to thy servant.'
      - 'Nevertheless, in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father’s sake:
        but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.'
      - Neither will I take away the whole kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy
        son, for the sake of David, my servant, and Jerusalem, which I have chosen.
      - And the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon, Adad, the Edomite, of the
        king’s seed, in Edom.
      - For when David was in Edom, and Joab, the general of the army, was gone up
        to bury them that were slain, and had killed every male in Edom,
      - (For Joab remained there six months with all Israel, till he had slain every
        male in Edom,)
      - 'Then Adad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants, with him,
        to go into Egypt: and Adad was then a little boy.'
      - 'And they arose out of Madian, and came into Pharan, and they took men with
        them from Pharan, and went into Egypt, to Pharao, the king of Egypt: who gave
        him a house, and appointed him victuals, and assigned him land.'
      - And Adad found great favour before Pharao, insomuch that he gave him to wife
        the own sister of his wife, Taphnes, the queen.
      - 'And the sister of Taphnes bore him his son, Genubath; and Taphnes brought
        him up in the house of Pharao: and Genubath dwelt with Pharao among his children.'
      - 'And when Adad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that
        Joab, the general of the army, was dead, he said to Pharao: Let me depart,
        that I may go to my own country.'
      - 'And Pharao said to him: Why, what is wanting to thee with me, that thou seekest
        to go to thy own country? But he answered: Nothing; yet I beseech thee to
        let me go.'
      - God also raised up against him an adversary, Razon, the son of Eliada, who
        had fled from his master, Adarezer, the king of Soba.
      - 'And he gathered men against him, and he became a captain of robbers, when
        David slew them of Soba: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and they
        made him king in Damascus.'
      - 'And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon: and this is the
        evil of Adad, and his hatred against Israel; and he reigned in Syria.'
      - Jeroboam also, the son of Nabat, an Ephrathite, of Sareda, a servant of Solomon,
        whose mother was named Sarua, a widow woman, lifted up his hand against the
        king.
      - And this is the cause of his rebellion against him; for Solomon built Mello,
        and filled up the breach of the city of David, his father.
      - 'And Jeroboam was a valiant and mighty man: and Solomon seeing him a young
        man ingenious and industrious, made him chief over the tributes of all the
        house of Joseph.'
      - 'So it came to pass at that time, that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and
        the prophet Ahias, the Silonite, clad with a new garment, found him in the
        way: and they two were alone in the field.'
      - 'And Ahias taking his new garment, wherewith he was clad, divided it into
        twelve parts:'
      - 'And he said to Jeroboam: Take to thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lord,
        the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon,
        and will give thee ten tribes.'
      - 'But one tribe shall remain to him for the sake of my servant, David, and
        Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:'
      - 'Because he hath forsaken me, and hath adored Astarthe, the goddess of the
        Sidonians, and Chamos, the god of Moab, and Moloch, the god of the children
        of Ammon: and hath not walked in my ways, to do justice before me, and to
        keep my precepts, and judgments, as did David, his father.'
      - Yet I will not take away all the kingdom out of his hand, but I will make
        him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose,
        who kept my commandments, and my precepts.
      - 'But I will take away the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give thee
        ten tribes:'
      - And to his son I will give one tribe, that there may remain a lamp for my
        servant, David, before me always in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen,
        that my name might be there.
      - And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth,
        and thou shalt be king over Israel.
      - 'If then thou wilt hearken to all that I shall command thee, and wilt walk
        in my ways, and do what is right before me, keeping my commandments and my
        precepts, as David, my servant, did: I will be with thee, and will build thee
        up a faithful house, as I built a house for David, and I will deliver Israel
        to thee:'
      - And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but yet not for ever.
      - 'Solomon, therefore, sought to kill Jeroboam: but he arose, and fled into
        Egypt, to Sesac, the king of Egypt, and was in Egypt till the death of Solomon.'
      - 'And the rest of the words of Solomon, and all that he did and his wisdom:
        behold they are all written in the book of the words of the days of Solomon.'
      - And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem, over all Israel, were forty
        years.
      - And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David, his
        father; and Roboam, his son, reigned in his stead.

      - 'And they sent and called him: and Jeroboam came, and all the multitude of
        Israel, and they spoke to Roboam, saying:'
      - 'Thy father laid a grievous yoke upon us: now, therefore, do thou take off
        a little of the grievous service of thy father, and of his most heavy yoke,
        which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.'

      - 'King Roboam took counsel with the old men, that stood before Solomon, his
        father, while he yet lived, and he said: What counsel do you give me, that
        I may answer this people?'
      - 'They said to him: If thou wilt yield to this people to day, and condescend
        to them, and grant their petition, and wilt speak gentle words to them, they
        will be thy servants always.'
      - But he left the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted
        with the young men that had been brought up with him, and stood before him.
      - 'And he said to them: What counsel do you give me, that I may answer this
        people, who have said to me: Make the yoke, which thy father put upon us,
        lighter?'
      - 'And the young men that had been brought up with him, said: Thus shalt thou
        speak to this people, who have spoken to thee, saying: Thy father made our
        yoke heavy, do thou ease us. Thou shalt say to them: My little finger is thicker
        than the back of my father.'
      - 'And now my father put a heavy yoke upon you, but I will add to your yoke:
        my father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.'
      - 'So Jeroboam, and all the people, came to Roboam the third day, as the king
        had appointed, saying: Come to me again the third day.'
      - And the king answered the people roughly, leaving the counsel of the old men,
        which they had given him,
      - 'And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying: My
        father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: My father beat you
        with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.'
      - 'And the king condescended not to the people: for the Lord was turned away
        from him, to make good his word, which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias,
        the Silonite, to Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.'
      - 'Then the people, seeing that the king would not hearken to them, answered
        him, saying: What portion have we in David? or what inheritance in the son
        of Isai? Go home to thy dwellings, O Israel: now, David, look to thy own house.
        So Israel departed to their dwellings.'
      - But as for all the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Juda, Roboam
        reigned over them.
      - 'Then king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tribute: and all Israel stoned
        him, and he died. Wherefore king Roboam made haste to get him up into his
        chariot, and he fled to Jerusalem:'
      - And Israel revolted from the house of David, unto this day.
      - And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that
        they gathered an assembly, and sent and called him, and made him king over
        all Israel, and there was none that followed the house of David but the tribe
        of Juda only.
      - And Roboam came to Jerusalem, and gathered together all the house of Juda,
        and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred fourscore thousand chosen men for war,
        to fight against the house of Israel, and to bring the kingdom again under
        Roboam, the son of Solomon.
      - 'But the word of the Lord came to Semeias, the man of God, saying:'
      - 'Speak to Roboam, the son of Solomon, the king of Juda, and to all the house

        journey, as the Lord had commanded them.'
      - And Jeroboam built Sichem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt there, and going out
        from thence, he built Phanuel.

      - And behold there came a man of God out of Juda, by the word of the Lord, to
        Bethel, when Jeroboam was standing upon the altar, and burning incense.
      - 'And he cried out against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said: O altar,
        altar, thus saith the Lord: Behold a child shall be born to the house of David,
        Josias by name, and he shall immolate upon thee the priests of the high places,
        who now burn incense upon thee, and he shall burn men’s bones upon thee.'
      - 'And he gave a sign the same day, saying: This shall be the sign, that the
        Lord hath spoken: Behold the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon
        it, shall be poured out.'
      - 'And when the king had heard the word of the man of God, which he had cried

        withered: and he was not able to draw it back again to him.'
      - The altar also was rent, and the ashes were poured out from the altar, according

        the face of the Lord, and the king’s hand was restored to him, and it became

      - 'And the king said to the man of God: Come home with me to dine, and I will

        commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat bread, nor drink water, thy dead

        old prophet dwelt.

        killed him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke to him.'
      - 'And he said to his sons: Saddle me an ass. And when they had saddled it,'
      - 'And he was gone, he found the dead body cast in the way, and the ass and
        the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten of the dead body,
        nor hurt the ass.'
      - And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass,
        and going back brought it into the city of the old prophet, to mourn for him.
      - 'And he laid his dead body in his own sepulchre: and they mourned over him,
        saying: Alas! alas, my brother.'
      - 'And when they had mourned over him, he said to his sons: When I am dead,
        bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried: lay my bones beside
        his bones.'
      - 'For assuredly the word shall come to pass which he hath foretold in the word
        of the Lord, against the altar that is in Bethel: and against all the temples
        of the high places, that are in the cities of Samaria.'
      - 'After these words, Jeroboam came not back from his wicked way: but on the
        contrary, he made of the meanest of the people priests of the high places:
        whosoever would, he filled his hand, and he was made a priest of the high
        places.'
      - And for this cause did the house of Jeroboam sin, and was cut off, and destroyed
        from the face of the earth.

      - At that time Abia, the son of Jeroboam, fell sick.
      - 'And Jeroboam said to his wife: Arise, and change thy dress, that thou be
        not known to be the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Silo, where Ahias, the prophet
        is, who told me that I should reign over this people.'
      - 'Take also with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a pot of honey, and go
        to him: for he will tell thee what will become of this child.'
      - 'Jeroboam’s wife did as he told her: and rising up, went to Silo, and came
        to the house of Ahias; but he could not see, for his eyes were dim by reason
        of his age.'
      - 'And the Lord said to Ahias: Behold the wife of Jeroboam cometh in, to consult
        thee concerning her son, that is sick: thus and thus shalt thou speak to her.
        So when she was coming in, and made as if she were another woman,'
      - 'Ahias heard the sound of her feet, coming in at the door, and said: Come
        in, thou wife of Jeroboam: why dost thou feign thyself to be another? But
        I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.'
      - 'Go, and tell Jeroboam: Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: For as much
        as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people
        Israel;'
      - 'And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to thee, and
        thou hast not been as my servant, David, who kept my commandments, and followed
        me with all his heart, doing that which was well pleasing in my sight:'
      - 'But hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast made thee strange
        gods, and molten gods, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy
        back:'
      - 'Therefore, behold I will bring evils upon the house of Jeroboam, and will
        cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut
        up, and the last in Israel: and I will sweep away the remnant of the house
        of Jeroboam, as dung is swept away till all be clean.'
      - 'Them that shall die of Jeroboam in the city, the dogs shall eat: and them
        that shall die in the field, the birds of the air shall devour: for the Lord
        hath spoken it.'
      - 'Arise thou, therefore, and go to thy house: and when thy feet shall be entering
        into the city, the child shall die,'
      - 'And all Israel shall mourn for him, and shall bury him: for he only of Jeroboam
        shall be laid in a sepulchre, because in his regard there is found a good
        word from the Lord, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.'
      - 'And the Lord hath appointed himself a king over Israel, who shall cut off
        the house of Jeroboam in this day, and in this time:'
      - 'And the Lord God shall strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water: and
        he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers,
        and shall scatter them beyond the river: because they have made to themselves
        groves, to provoke the Lord.'
      - And the Lord shall give up Israel for the sins of Jeroboam, who hath sinned,
        and made Israel to sin.
      - 'And the wife of Jeroboam arose, and departed, and came to Thersa: and when
        she was coming in to the threshold of the house, the child died,'
      - And they buried him. And all Israel mourned for him, according to the word
        of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahias, the prophet.
      - And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold
        they are written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel.
      - 'And the days that Jeroboam reigned, were two and twenty years: and he slept
        with his fathers: and Nadab, his son, reigned in his stead.'
      - 'And Roboam, the son of Solomon, reigned in Juda: Roboam was one and forty
        years old when he began to reign: and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem,
        the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name
        there. And his mother’s name was Naama, an Ammonitess.'
      - And Juda did evil in the sight of the Lord, and provoked him above all that
        their fathers had done, in their sins which they committed.
      - 'For they also built them altars, and statues, and groves, upon every high
        hill, and under every green tree:'
      - There were also the effeminate in the land, and they did according to all
        the abominations of the people, whom the Lord had destroyed before the face
        of the children of Israel.
      - And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac, king of Egypt, came up
        against Jerusalem.
      - 'And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the king’s treasures,
        and carried all off: as also the shields of gold which Solomon had made:'
      - And Roboam made shields of brass instead of them, and delivered them into
        the hand of the captains of the shieldbearers, and of them that kept watch
        before the gate of the king’s house.
      - 'And when the king went into the house of the Lord, they whose office it was
        to go before him, carried them: and afterwards they brought them back to the
        armoury of the shieldbearers.'
      - Now the rest of the acts of Roboam, and all that he did, behold they are written
        in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda.
      - And there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam always.
      - 'And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with them, in the city
        of David: and his mother’s name was Naama, an Ammonitess: and Abiam, his son,
        reigned in his stead.'

      - Now in the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, Abiam
        reigned over Juda.
      - 'He reigned three years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Maacha, the
        daughter of Abessalom.'
      - 'And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him:
        and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David,
        his father.'
      - 'But for David’s sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set
        up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:'
      - Because David had done that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and had
        not turned aside from any thing that he commanded him, all the days of his
        life, except the matter of Urias, the Hethite.
      - But there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam all the time of his life.
      - And the rest of the words of Abiam, and all that he did, are they not written
        in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? And there was war
        between Abiam and Jeroboam.
      - 'And Abiam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David:
        and Asa, his son, reigned in his stead.'
      - So in the twentieth year of Jeroboam, king of Israel, reigned Asa, king of
        Juda,
      - And he reigned one and forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacha,
        the daughter of Abessalom.
      - 'And Asa did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as did David,
        his father:'
      - And he took away the effeminate out of the land, and removed all the filth
        of the idols, which his fathers had made.
      - 'Moreover, he also removed his mother, Maacha, from being the princess in
        the sacrifices of Priapus, and in the grove which she had consecrated to him:
        and he destroyed her den, and broke in pieces the filthy idol, and burnt it
        by the torrent Cedron:'
      - 'But the high places he did not take away. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa
        was perfect with the Lord all his days:'
      - And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and he had vowed,
        into the house of the Lord, silver and gold, and vessels.
      - And there was war between Asa, and Baasa, king of Israel, all their days.
      - And Baasa, king of Israel, went up against Juda, and built Rama, that no man
        might go out or come in of the side of Asa, king of Juda.
      - 'Then Asa took all the silver and gold that remained in the treasures of the
        house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered
        it into the hands of his servants: and sent them to Benadad, son of Tabremon,
        the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying:'
      - 'There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father:
        therefore I have sent thee presents of silver and gold: and I desire thee
        to come, and break thy league with Baasa, king of Israel, that he may depart
        from me.'
      - Benadad, hearkening to king Asa, sent the captains of his army against the
        cities of Israel, and they smote Ahion, and Dan, and Abeldomum Maacha, and
        all Cenneroth; that is all the land of Nephthali.
      - And when Baasa had heard this, he left off building Rama, and returned into
        Thersa.
      - 'But king Asa sent word into all Juda, saying: Let no man be excused: and
        they took away the stones from Rama, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasa
        had been building, and with them king Asa built Gabaa of Benjamin, and Maspha.'
      - But the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his strength, and all that he
        did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the
        words of the days of the kings of Juda? But in the time of his old age he
        was diseased in his feet.
      - And he slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David,
        his father. And Josaphat, his son, reigned in his place.
      - 'But Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, reigned over Israel the second year of Asa,
        king of Juda: and he reigned over Israel two years.'
      - And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of his father,
        and in his sins, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
      - 'And Baasa, the son of Ahias, of the house of Issachar, conspired against
        him, and slew him in Gebbethon, which is a city of the Philistines: for Nadab
        and all Israel besieged Gebbethon.'
      - So Baasa slew him in the third year of Asa, king of Juda, and reigned in his
        place.
      - 'And when he was king, he cut off all the house of Jeroboam: he left not so
        much as one soul of his seed, till he had utterly destroyed him, according
        to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias, the Silonite:'
      - Because of the sin of Jeroboam, which he had sinned, and wherewith he had
        made Israel to sin, and for the offence wherewith he provoked the Lord, the
        God of Israel.
      - But the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written
        in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
      - And there was war between Asa and Baasa, the king of Israel, all their days.
      - In the third year of Asa, king of Juda, Baasa, the son of Ahias, reigned over
        all Israel, in Thersa, four and twenty years.
      - And he did evil before the Lord, and walked in the ways of Jeroboam, and in
        his sins, wherewith he made Israel to sin.

        his hands, to become as the house of Jeroboam: for this cause he slew him;
        that is to say, Jehu, the son of Hanani, the prophet.'
      - In the six and twentieth year of Asa, king of Juda, Ela, the son of Baasa,
        reigned over Israel, in Thersa, two years.
      - 'And his servant Zambri, who was captain of half the horsemen, rebelled against
        him: now Ela was drinking in Thersa, and drunk in the house of Arsa, the governor
        of Thersa.'
      - And Zambri rushing in, struck him, and slew him, in the seven and twentieth
        year of Asa, king of Juda and he reigned in his stead.
      - And when he was king, and sat upon his throne, he slew all the house of Baasa,
        and he left not one thereof to piss against a wall and all his kinsfolks and
        friends.
      - And Zambri destroyed all the house of Baasa, according to the word of the
        Lord, that he had spoken to Baasa, in the hand of Jehu, the prophet,
      - For all the sins of Baasa, and the sins of Ela, his son, who sinned, and made
        Israel to sin, provoking the Lord, the God of Israel, with their vanities.
      - But the rest of the acts of Ela, and all that he did, are they not written

      - 'In the seven and twentieth year of Asa, king of Juda, Zambri reigned seven

      - And when they heard that Zambri had rebelled, and slain the king, all Israel
        made Amri their king, who was general over Israel in the camp that day.
      - And Amri went up, and all Israel with him, from Gebbethon, and they besieged
        Thersa.
      - 'And Zambri, seeing that the city was about to be taken, went into the palace,
        and burnt himself with the king’s house: and he died'
      - In his sins, which he had sinned, doing evil before the Lord, and walking
        in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin, wherewith he made Israel to sin.

      - 'Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: one half of the people
        followed Thebni, the son of Gineth, to make him king: and one half followed
        Amri.'
      - 'But the people that were with Amri, prevailed over the people that followed
        Thebni, the son of Gineth: and Thebni died, and Amri reigned.'

        and cut it in pieces, and lay it upon wood, but put no fire under: and I will
        dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under it.'
      - 'Call ye on the names of your gods, and I will call on the name of my Lord:
        and the God that shall answer by fire, let him be God. And all the people
        answering, said: A very good proposal.'
      - 'Then Elias said to the prophets of Baal: Choose you one bullock and dress
        it first, because you are many: and call on the names of your gods; but put
        no fire under.'

        on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying: O Baal, hear us.

        voice: for he is a god; and perhaps he is talking, or is in an inn, or on
        a journey; or perhaps he is asleep, and must be awaked.'

        upon the wood.
      - 'And he said: Fill four buckets with water, and pour it upon the burnt offering,
        and upon the wood. And again he said: Do the same the second time. And when
        they had done it the second time, he said: Do the same also the third time.
        And they did so the third time.'
      - And the water run round about the altar, and the trench was filled with water.
      - 'And when it was now time to offer the holocaust, Elias, the prophet, came
        near and said: O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, shew this day
        that thou art the God of Israel, and I thy servant, and that according to
        thy commandment I have done all these things.'
      - 'Hear me, O Lord, hear me: that this people may learn that thou art the Lord
        God, and that thou hast turned their heart again.'
      - Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the holocaust, and the wood,
        and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.

        The Lord, he is God; the Lord, he is God.'
      - 'And Elias said to them: Take the prophets of Baal, and let not one of them
        escape. And when they had taken them, Elias brought them down to the torrent
        Cison, and killed them there.'

        of rain.'

        casting himself down upon the earth, put his face between his knees,'
      - 'And he said to his servant: Go up, and look towards the sea. And he went
        up, and looked, and said: There is nothing. And again he said to him: Return
        seven times.'
      - 'And at the seventh time: Behold a little cloud arose out of the sea like
        a man’s foot. And he said: Go up, and say to Achab: Prepare thy chariot, and
        go down, lest the rain prevent thee.'
      - 'And while he turned himself this way and that way, behold the heavens grew
        dark, with clouds and wind, and there fell a great rain. And Achab getting
        up, went away to Jezrahel:'
      - And the hand of the Lord was upon Elias, and he girded up his loins, and ran
        before Achab, till he came to Jezrahel.

        seven and twenty thousand men, that were left. And Benadad fleeing, went into
        the city, into a chamber that was within a chamber.'
      - 'And his servants said to him: Behold, we have heard that the kings of the
        house of Israel are merciful; so let us put sackcloths on our loins, and ropes
        on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: perhaps he will save our lives.'
      - 'So they girded sackcloths on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and
        came to the king of Israel, and said to him: Thy servant, Benadad, saith:
        I beseech thee let me have my life. And he said: If he be yet alive, he is
        my brother.'
      - 'The men took this for good luck: and in haste caught the word out of his
        mouth, and said: Thy brother Benadad. And he said to them: Go, and bring him
        to me. Then Benadad came out to him, and he lifted him up into his chariot.'
      - 'And he said to him: The cities which my father took from thy father, I will
        restore: and do thou make thee streets in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria
        and having made a league, I will depart from thee. So he made a league with
        him, and let him go.'
      - 'Then a certain man of the sons of the prophets, said to his companion, in
        the word of the Lord: Strike me. But he would not strike.'
      - 'Then he said to him: Because thou wouldst not hearken to the word of the
        Lord, behold thou shalt depart from me, and a lion shall slay thee. And when
        he was gone a little from him, a lion found him, and slew him.'
      - 'Then he found another man, and said to him: Strike me. And he struck him
        and wounded him.'
      - So the prophet went, and met the king in the way, and disguised himself by
        sprinkling dust on his face and his eyes.
      - 'And as the king passed by, he cried to the king, and said: Thy servant went
        out to fight hand to hand: and when a certain man was run away, one brought
        him to me, and said: Keep this man: and if he shall slip away, thy life shall
        be for his life, or thou shalt pay a talent of silver.'
      - 'And whilst I, in the hurry, turned this way and that, on a sudden he was
        not to be seen. And the king of Israel said to him: This is thy judgment,
        which thyself hast decreed.'
      - But he forthwith wiped off the dust from his face, and the king of Israel
        knew him, that he was one of the prophets.
      - 'And he said to him: Thus saith the Lord. Because thou hast let go out of
        thy hand a man worthy of death, thy life shall be for his life, and thy people
        for his people.'
      - And the king of Israel returned to his house, slighting to hear, and raging
        came into Samaria.
  - chapter_intro: 'Naboth, for denying his vineyard to king Achab, is by Jezabel’s
      commandment, falsely accused and stoned to death. For which crime Elias denounceth
      to Achab the judgments of God: upon his humbling himself the sentence is mitigated.'

      - And after these things, Naboth the Jezrahelite, who was in Jezrahel, had at
        that time a vineyard, near the palace of Achab, king of Samaria.
      - 'And Achab spoke to Naboth, saying: Give me thy vineyard, that I may make
        me a garden of herbs, because it is nigh, and adjoining to my house; and I
        will give thee for it a better vineyard: or if thou think it more convenient
        for thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.'
      - 'Naboth answered him: The Lord be merciful to me, and not let me give thee
        the inheritance of my fathers.'
      - 'And Achab came into his house angry and fretting, because of the word that
        Naboth, the Jezrahelite, had spoken to him, saying: I will not give thee the
        inheritance of my fathers. And casting himself upon his bed, he turned away
        his face to the wall, and would eat no bread.'
      - 'And Jezabel, his wife, went in to him, and said to him: What is the matter
        that thy soul is so grieved? and why eatest thou no bread?'
      - 'And he answered her: I spoke to Naboth, the Jezrahelite, and said to him:
        Give me thy vineyard, and take money for it: or if it please thee, I will
        give thee a better vineyard for it. And he said: I will not give thee my vineyard.'
      - Then Jezabel, his wife, said to him. Thou art of great authority indeed, and
        governest well the kingdom of Israel. Arise, and eat bread, and be of good
        cheer; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite.
      - So she wrote letters in Achab’s name, and sealed them with his ring, and sent
        them to the ancients, and the chief men that were in his city, and that dwelt
        with Naboth.
      - 'And this was the tenor of the letters: Proclaim a fast, and make Naboth sit
        among the chief of the people;'
      - 'And suborn two men, sons of Belial, against him, and let them bear false
        witness; that he hath blasphemed God and the king: and then carry him out,
        and stone him, and so let him die.'
      - And the men of his city, the ancients and nobles, that dwelt with him in the
        city, did as Jezabel had commanded them, and as it was written in the letters
        which she had sent to them;
      - They proclaimed a fast, and made Naboth sit among the chief of the people.
      - 'And bringing two men, sons of the devil, they made them sit against him:
        and they, like men of the devil, bore witness against him before the people:
        saying: Naboth hath blasphemed God and the king. Wherefore they brought him
        forth without the city, and stoned him to death.'
      - 'And they sent to Jezabel, saying: Naboth is stoned, and is dead.'
      - 'And it came to pass, when Jezabel heard that Naboth was stoned, and dead,
        that she said to Achab: Arise, and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth,
        the Jezrahelite, who would not agree with thee, and give it thee for money:
        for Naboth is not alive, but dead.'
      - And when Achab heard this, to wit, that Naboth was dead, he arose, and went
        down into the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite, to take possession of it.
      - 'And the word of the Lord came to Elias, the Thesbite, saying:'
      - 'Arise, and go down to meet Achab, king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold
        he is going down to the vineyard of Naboth, to take possession of it:'
      - 'And thou shalt speak to him, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast slain:
        moreover also thou hast taken possession. And after these words thou shalt
        add: Thus saith the Lord: In this place, wherein the dogs have licked the
        blood of Naboth, they shall lick thy blood also.'
      - 'And Achab said to Elias: Hast thou found me thy enemy? He said: I have found
        thee because thou art sold, to do evil in the sight of the Lord.'
      - Behold I will bring evil upon thee, and I will cut down thy posterity, and
        I will kill of Achab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut
        up, and the last in Israel.
      - 'And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and
        like the house of Baasa the son of Ahias: for what thou hast done to provoke
        me to anger, and for making Israel to sin.'
      - 'And of Jezabel also, the Lord spoke, saying: The dogs shall eat Jezabel in
        the field of Jezrahel.'
      - 'If Achab die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field,
        the birds of the air shall eat him.'
      - 'Now, there was not such another as Achab, who was sold to do evil in the
        sight of the Lord: for his wife, Jezabel, set him on,'
      - And he became abominable, insomuch that he followed the idols which the Amorrhites
        had made, whom the Lord destroyed before the face of the children of Israel.
      - And when Achab had heard these words, he rent his garments, and put haircloth
        upon his flesh, and fasted, and slept in sackcloth, and walked with his head
        cast down.
      - 'And the word of the Lord came to Elias, the Thesbite, saying:'
      - Hast thou not seen Achab humbled before me? therefore, because he hath humbled
        himself, for my sake, I will not bring the evil in his days, but in his son’s
        days will I bring the evil upon his house.

        and thy people are one: and my horsemen are thy horsemen. And Josaphat said
        to the king of Israel: Inquire, I beseech thee, this day the word of the Lord.'
      - 'Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and
        he said to them: Shall I go to Ramoth Galaad to fight, or shall I forbear?
        They answered: Go up, and the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.'

        inquire by him?'

        may inquire of the Lord; Micheas, the son of Jemla: but I hate him, for he
        doth not prophecy good to me, but evil. And Josaphat said: Speak not so, O
        king.'
      - 'Then the king of Israel called an eunuch, and said to him: Make haste, and
        bring hither Micheas, the son of Jemla.'
      - And the king of Israel, and Josaphat, king of Juda, sat each on his throne,
        clothed with royal robes, in a court, by the entrance of the gate of Samaria,
        and all the prophets prophesied before them.
      - 'And Sedecias, the son of Chanaana, made himself horns of iron, and said:
        Thus saith the Lord: With these shalt thou push Syria, till thou destroy it.'

        let thy word, therefore, be like to theirs, and speak that which is good.'

      - 'And the Lord said: Who shall deceive Achab, king of Israel, that he may go
        up, and fall at Ramoth Galaad? And one spoke words of this manner, and another
        otherwise.'
      - 'And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said: I will
        deceive him. And the Lord said to him: By what means?'
      - 'And he said: I will go forth, and be a lying spirit, in the mouth of all
        his prophets. And the Lord said: Thou shalt deceive him, and shalt prevail:
        go forth, and do so.'
      - Now, therefore, behold the Lord hath given a lying spirit in the mouth of
        all thy prophets that are here, and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee.
      - 'And Sedecias, the son of Chanaana, came, and struck Micheas on the cheek,
        and said: Hath then the spirit of the Lord left me, and spoken to thee?'
      - 'And Micheas said: Thou shalt see in the day when thou shalt go into a chamber
        within a chamber to hide thyself.'
      - 'And the king of Israel said: Take Micheas and let him abide with Amon, the

        And he said: Hear, all ye people.'
      - So the king of Israel, and Josaphat, king of Juda, went up to Ramoth-Galaad.
      - 'And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: Take thy armour, and go into the
        battle, and put on thy own garments. But the king of Israel changed his dress,
        and went into the battle.'
      - 'And the king of Syria had commanded the two and thirty captains of the chariots,
        saying: You shall not fight against any, small or great, but against the king
        of Israel only.'
      - 'So when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat, they suspected that he
        was the king of Israel, and making a violent assault, they fought against
        him: and Josaphat cried out.'
      - And the captains of the chariots perceived that he was not the king of Israel,
        and they turned away from him.
      - 'And a certain man bent his bow, shooting at a venture, and chanced to strike
        the king of Israel, between the lungs and the stomach. But he said to the
        driver of his chariot: Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the army, for I
        am grievously wounded.'
      - 'And the battle was fought that day, and the king of Israel stood in his chariot
        against the Syrians, and he died in the evening: and the blood ran out of
        the wound into the midst of the chariot.'
      - 'And the herald proclaimed through all the army, before the sun set, saying:
        Let every man return to his own city, and to his own country.'
      - 'And the king died, and was carried into Samaria: and they buried the king
        in Samaria.'
      - And they washed his chariot in the pool of Samaria and the dogs licked up
        his blood, and they washed the reins according to the word of the Lord which
        he had spoken.
      - But the rest of the acts of Achab, and all that he did, and the house of ivory
        that he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the
        book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
      - So Achab slept with his fathers; and Ochozias, his son, reigned in his stead.
      - But Josaphat, the son of Asa, began to reign over Juda, in the fourth year
        of Achab, king of Israel.
      - 'He was five and thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned five
        and twenty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Azuba, the daughter
        of Salai.'
      - 'And he walked in all the way of Asa, his father, and he declined not from
        it: and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord.'
      - Nevertheless, he took not away the high places for as yet the people offered
        sacrifice, and burnt incense in the high places.
      - And Josaphat had peace with the king of Israel.
      - But the rest of the acts of Josaphat, and his works which he did, and his
        battles, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the
        kings of Juda?
      - And the remnant also of the effeminate, who remained in the days of Asa, his
        father, he took out of the land.
      - And there was then no king appointed in Edom.
      - 'But king Josaphat made navies on the sea, to sail into Ophir for gold: but
        they could not go, for the ships were broken in Asiongaber.'
      - 'Then Ochozias, the son of Achab, said to Josaphat: Let my servants go with
        thy servants in the ships. And Josaphat would not.'
      - 'And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city
        of David, his father: and Joram, his son, reigned in his stead.'
      - And Ochozias, the son of Achab, began to reign over Israel, in Samaria, in
        the seventeenth year of Josaphat, king of Juda, and he reigned over Israel
        two years.
      - And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father
        and his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who made Israel
        to sin.
      - He served also Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked the Lord, the God of
        Israel, according to all that his father had done.
