book_intro: 'Philemon, a noble citizen of Colossa, had a servant named Onesimus, who
  robbed him and fled to Rome, where he met St. Paul, who was then a prisoner there
  the first time. The apostle took compassion on him and received him with tenderness
  and converted him to the faith; for he was a Gentile before. St. Paul sends him
  back to his master with this Epistle in his favour: and though he beseeches Philemon
  to pardon him, yet the Apostle writes with becoming dignity and authority. It contains
  divers profitable instructions and points out the charity and humanity that masters
  should have for their servants.'

    verse:
      - ~
      - 'Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our
        beloved and fellow labourer,'
      - And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and
        to the church which is in thy house.
      - Grace to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
      - I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers.
      - 'Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus and towards
        all the saints:'
      - That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment
        of every good work that is in you in Christ Jesus.
      - For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels
        of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.
      - 'Wherefore, though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus to command thee
        that which is to the purpose:'
      - For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul, an
        old man and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.
      - I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,
      - 'Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee but now is profitable both
        to me and thee:'
      - Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels.
      - Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered
        to me in the bands of the gospel.
      - 'But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not
        be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.'
      - 'For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee that thou mightest
        receive him again for ever:'
      - Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially
        to me. But how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord?
      - If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.
      - And if he hath wronged thee in any thing or is in thy debt, put that to my
        account.
      - 'I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee
        that thou owest me thy own self also.'
      - Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord! Refresh my bowels in the Lord.
      - 'Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt
        also do more than I say.'
      - But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers
        I shall be given unto you.
      - 'There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus:'
      - Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow labourers.
      - The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
