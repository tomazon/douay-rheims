book_intro: 'St. Paul wrote this Epistle to the Christians in Palestine, the most
  part of whom being Jews before their conversion, they were called Hebrews. He exhorts
  them to be thoroughly converted and confirmed in the faith of Christ, clearly shewing
  them the preeminence of Christ’s priesthood above the Levitical, and also the excellence
  of the new law above the old. He commends faith by the example of the ancient fathers:
  and exhorts them to patience and perseverance and to remain in fraternal charity.
  It appears from chap. 13 that this Epistle was written in Italy, and probably at
  Rome, about twenty-nine years after our Lord’s Ascension.'

      - God, who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times past to the
        fathers by the prophets, last of all,
      - In these days, hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of
        all things, by whom also he made the world.
      - 'Who being the brightness of his glory and the figure of his substance and
        upholding all things by the word of his power, making purgation of sins, sitteth
        on the right hand of the majesty on high:'
      - Being made so much better than the angels as he hath inherited a more excellent
        name than they.
      - 'For to which of the angels hath he said at any time: Thou art my Son, to-day
        have I begotten thee? And again: I will be to him a Father, and he shall be
        to me a Son?'
      - 'And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith:
        And let all the angels of God adore him.'
      - 'And to the angels indeed he saith: He that maketh his angels spirits and
        his ministers a flame of fire.'
      - 'But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of justice
        is the sceptre of thy kingdom.'
      - 'Thou hast loved justice and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath
        anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.'
      - 'And: Thou in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works
        of thy hands are the heavens.'
      - 'They shall perish: but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as
        a garment.'
      - 'And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed. But thou
        art the selfsame: and thy years shall not fail.'
      - 'But to which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand, until
        I make thy enemies thy footstool?'
      - Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them who shall
        receive the inheritance of salvation?

      - Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard
        lest perhaps we should let them slip.
      - 'For if the word spoken by angels became steadfast and every transgression
        and disobedience received a just recompense of reward:'
      - How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? Which, having begun
        to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.
      - God also bearing them witness by signs and wonders and divers miracles and
        distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.
      - For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come, whereof we speak.
      - 'But one in a certain place hath testified, saying: What is man, that thou
        art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?'
      - 'Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels: thou hast crowned him
        with glory and honour and hast set him over the works of thy hands.'
      - Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected
        all things to him he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as
        yet all things subject to him.
      - 'But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering
        of death, crowned with glory and honour: that, through the grace of God he
        might taste death for all.'
      - For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, who
        had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author of their salvation,
        by his passion.
      - 'For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one.
        For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:'
      - 'I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I
        praise thee.'
      - 'And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold I and my children,
        whom God hath given me.'
      - 'Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also
        himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same: that, through death,
        he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil:'
      - And might deliver them, who through the fear of death were all their lifetime
        subject to servitude.
      - 'For nowhere doth he take hold of the angels: but of the seed of Abraham he
        taketh hold.'
      - Wherefore, it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren,
        that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest before God, that
        he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people.
      - For in that wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted he is able to
        succour them also that are tempted.

        apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:'
      - Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.
      - For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as
        he that hath built the house hath greater honour than the house.
      - 'For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things is God.'
      - 'And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony
        of those things which were to be said:'
      - 'But Christ, as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast
        the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.'
      - 'Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To-day if you shall hear his voice,'
      - Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in
        the desert,
      - Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,
      - 'Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said:
        They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways.'
      - 'As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.'
      - Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of
        unbelief, to depart from the living God.
      - But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of
        you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
      - 'For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of
        his substance firm unto the end.'
      - 'While it is said: To day, if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts,
        as in that provocation.'
      - 'For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.'
      - And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned,
        whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?
      - 'And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to
        them that were incredulous?'

      - Let us fear therefore lest, the promise being left of entering into his rest,
        any of you should be thought to be wanting.
      - For unto us also it hath been declared in like manner as unto them. But the
        word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith of those things
        they heard.
      - 'For we, who have believed, shall enter into rest; as he said: As I have sworn
        in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest; and this indeed when the works
        from the foundation of the world were finished.'
      - 'For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus: And God rested the
        seventh day from all his works.'
      - 'And in this place again: If they shall enter into my rest.'
      - 'Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they to whom
        it was first preached did not enter because of unbelief:'
      - 'Again he limiteth a certain day, saying in David; To day, after so long a
        time as it is above said: To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your
        hearts.'
      - For if Jesus had given them rest he would never have afterwards spoken of
        another day.
      - There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.
      - For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his works,
        as God did from his.
      - 'Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest: lest any man fall into the
        same example of unbelief.'
      - 'For the word of God is living and effectual and more piercing than any two
        edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of
        the joints also and the marrow: and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents
        of the heart.'
      - 'Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are
        naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.'
      - 'Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus
        the Son of God: let us hold fast our confession.'
      - 'For we have not a high priest who cannot have compassion on our infirmities:
        but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.'
      - 'Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain
        mercy and find grace in seasonable aid.'
  - chapter_intro: The office of a high priest. Christ is our high priest.
    chapter_number: 5
    verses:
      - ~
      - 'For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things
        that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:'
      - 'Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he
        himself also is compassed with infirmity.'
      - And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for
        sins.
      - Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by
        God, as Aaron was.
      - 'So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest:
        but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten thee.'
      - 'As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according
        to the order of Melchisedech.'
      - Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers
        and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for
        his reverence.
      - And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things
        which he suffered.
      - 'And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal
        salvation:'
      - Called by God a high priest, according to the order of Melchisedech.
      - 'Of whom we have much to say and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because
        you are become weak to hear.'
      - 'For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught
        again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become
        such as have need of milk and not of strong meat.'
      - 'For every one that is a partaker of milk is unskilful in the word of justice:
        for he is a little child.'
      - 'But strong meat is for the perfect: for them who by custom have their senses
        exercised to the discerning of good and evil.'

        of faith towards God,'
      - Of the doctrine of baptisms and imposition of hands, and of the resurrection
        of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
      - And this will we do, if God permit.
      - For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have tasted also
        the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
      - Have moreover tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come,
      - 'And are fallen away: to be renewed again to penance, crucifying again to
        themselves the Son of God and making him a mockery.'
      - For the earth, that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it and bringeth
        forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God.
      - 'But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers is reprobate and very near
        unto a curse: whose end is to be burnt.'
      - But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer to salvation;
        though we speak thus.
      - For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work and the love which
        you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered and do minister to the
        saints.
      - 'And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same carefulness to the
        accomplishing of hope unto the end:'
      - That you become not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and
        patience shall inherit the promises.
      - For God making promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom he
        might swear, swore by himself,
      - 'Saying: Unless blessing I shall bless thee and multiplying I shall multiply
        thee.'
      - And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.
      - 'For men swear by one greater than themselves: and an oath for confirmation
        is the end of all their controversy.'
      - 'Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise
        the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:'
      - That by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we
        may have the strongest comfort, we who have fled for refuge to hold fast the
        hope set before us.
      - 'Which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and which entereth
        in even within the veil:'
      - Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest for ever
        according to the order of Melchisedech.

              ever, and hath no successor; but liveth and concurreth for ever with
              his ministers, the priests of the new testament, in all their functions.

        for ever.
      - Now consider how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave
        tithes out of the principal things.
      - 'And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood,
        have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that
        is to say, of their brethren: though they themselves also came out of the
        loins of Abraham.'
      - But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received tithes of Abraham
        and blessed him that had the promises.
      - And without all contradiction, that which is less is blessed by the better.

        that he liveth.'

        spoke nothing concerning priests.'

        high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,'
      - A minister of the holies and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched,
        and not man.
      - 'For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore
        it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.'
      - 'If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest: seeing that there would
        be others to offer gifts according to the law.'
      - 'Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered
        to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make
        all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount.'
      - But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator
        of a better testament which is established on better promises.
      - For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have
        been sought for a second.
      - 'For, finding fault with them, he saith: Behold the days shall come, saith
        the Lord: and I will perfect, unto the house of Israel and unto the house
        of Juda, a new testament:'
      - 'Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day
        when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because
        they continued not in my testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.'
      - 'For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after
        those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind: and in their
        heart will I write them. And I will be their God: and they shall be my people.'
      - 'And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother,
        saying: Know the Lord. For all shall know me, from the least to the greatest
        of them.'
      - 'Because I will be merciful to their iniquities: and their sins I will remember
        no more.'
      - Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth
        and groweth old is near its end.

      - The former indeed had also justifications of divine service and a worldly
        sanctuary.
      - For there was a tabernacle made the first, wherein were the candlesticks and
        the table and the setting forth of loaves, which is called the Holy.
      - 'And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies:'
      - Having a golden censer and the ark of the testament covered about on every
        part with gold, in which was a golden pot that had manna and the rod of Aaron
        that had blossomed and the tables of the testament.
      - 'And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the propitiatory: of
        which it is not needful to speak now particularly.'
      - Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle, the priests
        indeed always entered, accomplishing the offices of sacrifices.
      - 'But into the second, the high priest alone, once a year: not without blood,
        which he offereth for his own and the people’s ignorance:'
      - 'The Holy Ghost signifying this: That the way into the Holies was not yet
        made manifest, whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing.'
      - 'Which is a parable of the time present: according to which gifts and sacrifices
        are offered, which cannot, as to the conscience, make him perfect that serveth,
        only in meats and in drinks,'

        of correction.
      - 'But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater
        and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:'
      - Neither by the blood of goats or of calves, but by his own blood, entered
        once into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption.
      - 'For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer, being
        sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh:'
      - How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself
        unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living
        God?
      - 'And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament: that by means of his
        death for the redemption of those transgressions which were under the former
        testament, they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.'
      - For where there is a testament the death of the testator must of necessity
        come in.
      - 'For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is as yet of
        no strength, whilst the testator liveth.'
      - Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood.
      - For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the people,
        he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool and hyssop,
        and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people.
      - 'Saying: This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.'
      - The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he
        sprinkled with blood.
      - 'And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and
        without shedding of blood there is no remission.'
      - 'It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be
        cleansed with these: but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices
        than these.'
      - 'For Jesus is not entered into the Holies made with hands, the patterns of
        the true: but into Heaven itself, that he may appear now in the presence of
        God for us.'
      - 'Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into
        the Holies every year with the blood of others:'
      - For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world.
        But now once, at the end of ages, he hath appeared for the destruction of
        sin by the sacrifice of himself.
      - 'And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment:'
      - So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many. The second time
        he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation.

        year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect.
      - 'For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once
        cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer.'
      - 'But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year:'
      - For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken

      - 'Wherefore, when he cometh into the world he saith: Sacrifice and oblation
        thou wouldest not: but a body thou hast fitted to me.'
      - Holocausts for sin did not please thee.

        that he may establish that which followeth.'

        Christ once.
      - And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering and often offering the
        same sacrifices which can never take away sins.
      - But this man, offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right
        hand of God,
      - From henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his footstool.

      - And the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, which they that heard excused
        themselves, that the word might not be spoken to them.
      - 'For they did not endure that which was said: and if so much as a beast shall
        touch the mount, it shall be stoned.'
      - 'And so terrible was that which was seen, Moses said: I am frighted, and tremble.'
      - But you are come to mount Sion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly
        Jerusalem, and to the company of many thousands of angels,
      - And to the church of the firstborn who are written in the heavens, and to
        God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect,
      - And to Jesus the mediator of the new testament, and to the sprinkling of blood
        which speaketh better than that of Abel.
      - See that you refuse him not that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused
        him that spoke upon earth, much more shall not we that turn away from him
        that speaketh to us from heaven.
      - 'Whose voice then moved the earth; but now he promiseth, saying: Yet once
        more: and I will move, not only the earth, but heaven also.'
      - 'And in that he saith: Yet once more, he signifieth the translation of the
        moveable things as made, that those things may remain which are immoveable.'
      - 'Therefore, receiving an immoveable kingdom, we have grace: whereby let us
        serve, pleasing God, with fear and reverence.'
      - For our God is a consuming fire.

              to suffer with Christ, reproaches, persecutions, and even death, if
              they desire to partake of the benefit of his suffering for man’s redemption.

      '4':
        instances:
          - note: 'That is, in all things belonging to the marriage state. This is
              a warning to married people, not to abuse the sanctity of their state,
              by any liberties or irregularities contrary thereunto. Now it does not
              follow from this text that all persons are obliged to marry, even if
              the word omnibus were rendered, in all persons, instead of in all things:
              for if it was a precept, St. Paul himself would have transgressed it,
              as he never married. Moreover, those who have already made a vow to
              God to lead a single life, should they attempt to marry, they would
              incur their own damnation. 1 Tim. 5. 12.'
            quote: Or, Let marriage be honourable in all
    verses:
      - ~
      - Let the charity of the brotherhood abide in you.
      - 'And hospitality do not forget: for by this some, being not aware of it, have
        entertained angels.'
      - 'Remember them that are in bands, as if you were bound with them: and them
        that labour, as being yourselves also in the body.'
      - Marriage honourable in all, and the bed undefiled. For fornicators and adulterers
        God will judge.
      - 'Let your manners be without covetousness, contented with such things as you
        have. For he hath said: I will not leave thee: neither will I forsake thee.'
      - 'So that we may confidently say: The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what
        man shall do to me.'
      - 'Remember your prelates who have spoken the word of God to you: whose faith
        follow, considering the end of their conversation,'
      - 'Jesus Christ, yesterday, and today: and the same for ever.'
      - 'Be not led away with various and strange doctrines. For it is best that the
        heart be established with grace, not with meats: which have not profited those
        that walk in them.'
      - We have an altar whereof they have no power to eat who serve the tabernacle.
      - For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holies by the
        high priest for sin are burned without the camp.
      - Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood,
        suffered without the gate.
      - Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
      - 'For, we have not here a lasting city: but we seek one that is to come.'
      - By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God, that
        is to say, the fruit of lips confessing to his name.
      - 'And do not forget to do good and to impart: for by such sacrifices God’s
        favour is obtained.'
      - 'Obey your prelates and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render
        an account of your souls: that they may do this with joy and not with grief.
        For this is not expedient for you.'
      - Pray for us. For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to behave
        ourselves well in all things.
      - And I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
      - And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor
        of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,
      - Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which
        is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for
        ever and ever. Amen.
      - And I beseech you, brethren, that you suffer this word of consolation. For
        I have written to you in a few words.
      - 'Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty: with whom (if he come
        shortly) I will see you.'
      - Salute all your prelates and all the saints. The brethren from Italy salute
        you.
      - Grace be with you all. Amen.
