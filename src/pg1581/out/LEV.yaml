          - note: 'That is, a whole burnt offering (olokauston), so called, because
              the whole victim was consumed with fire; and given in such manner to
              God as wholly to evaporate, as it were, for his honour and glory; without
              having any part of it reserved for the use of man. The other sacrifices
              in the Old Testament were either offerings for sin, or peace offerings:
              and these latter again were either offered in thanksgiving for blessings
              received; or by way of prayer for new favours or graces. So that sacrifices
              were then offered to God for four different ends or intentions, answerable
              to the different obligations which man has to God: 1. By way of adoration,
              homage, praise, and glory due to his divine majesty. 2. By way of thanksgiving
              for all benefits received from him. 3. By way of confessing and craving
              pardon for sins. 4. By way of prayer and petition for grace and relief
              in all necessities. In the New Law we have but one sacrifice, viz.,
              that of the body and blood of Christ: but this one sacrifice of the
              New Testament perfectly answers all these four ends; and both priest
              and people, as often as it is celebrated, ought to join in offering
              it up for these four ends.'

    verse:
      - ~
      - 'And the Lord called Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of the testimony,
        saying:'
      - 'Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man among
        you that shall offer to the Lord a sacrifice of the cattle, that is, offering
        victims of oxen and sheep:'
      - If his offering be a holocaust, and of the herd, he shall offer a male without
        blemish, at the door of the testimony, to make the Lord favourable to him.
      - 'And he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim: and it shall be acceptable,
        and help to its expiation.'
      - 'And he shall immolate the calf before the Lord: and the priests the sons
        of Aaron shall offer the blood thereof, pouring it round about the altar,
        which is before the door of the tabernacle.'
      - 'And when they have flayed the victim, they shall cut the joints into pieces:'
      - And shall put fire on the altar, having before laid in order a pile of wood.
      - 'And they shall lay the parts that are cut out in order thereupon: to wit,
        the head, and all things that cleave to the liver;'
      - The entrails and feet being washed with water. And the priest shall burn them
        upon the altar for a holocaust, and a sweet savour to the Lord.
      - And if the offering be of the flocks, a holocaust of sheep or of goats, he
        shall offer a male without blemish.
      - 'And he shall immolate it at the side of the altar that looketh to the north,
        before the Lord: but the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof upon the
        altar round about.'
      - 'And they shall divide the joints, the head, and all that cleave to the liver:
        and shall lay them upon the wood, under which the fire is to be put.'
      - But the entrails and the feet they shall wash with water. And the priest shall
        offer it all and burn it all upon the altar for a holocaust, and most sweet
        savour to the Lord.
      - 'But if the oblation of a holocaust to the Lord be of birds, of turtles, or
        of young pigeons:'
      - 'The priest shall offer it at the altar: and twisting back the neck, and breaking
        the place of the wound, he shall make the blood run down upon the brim of
        the altar.'
      - But the crop of the throat, and the feathers he shall cast beside the altar
        at the east side, in the place where the ashes are wont to be poured out.
      - 'And he shall break the pinions thereof, and shall not cut, nor divide it
        with a knife: and shall burn it upon the altar, putting fire under the wood.
        It is a holocaust and oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord.'

      - 'When any one shall offer an oblation of sacrifice to the Lord, his offering
        shall be of fine flour: and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense,'
      - And shall bring it to the sons of Aaron the priests. And one of them shall
        take a handful of the flour and oil, and all the frankincense; and shall put
        it a memorial upon the altar for a most sweet savour to the Lord.
      - And the remnant of the sacrifice shall be Aaron’s, and his sons’, holy of
        holies of the offerings of the Lord.
      - 'But when thou offerest a sacrifice baked in the oven of flour, to wit, loaves
        without leaven, tempered with oil, and unleavened wafers, anointed with oil:'
      - 'If thy oblation be from the fryingpan, of flour tempered with oil, and without
        leaven:'
      - Thou shalt divide it into little pieces, and shalt pour oil upon it.
      - And if the sacrifice be from the gridiron, in like manner the flour shall
        be tempered with oil.
      - And when thou offerest it to the Lord, thou shalt deliver it to the hands
        of the priest.
      - And when he hath offered it, he shall take a memorial out of the sacrifice,
        and burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour to the Lord.
      - 'And whatsoever is left, shall be Aaron’s, and his sons’: holy of holies of
        the offerings of the Lord.'
      - 'Every oblation that is offered to the Lord shall be made without leaven:
        neither shall any leaven or honey be burnt in the sacrifice to the Lord.'
      - 'You shall offer only the firstfruits of them and gifts: but they shall not
        be put upon the altar, for a savour of sweetness.'
      - 'Whatsoever sacrifice thou offerest, thou shalt season it with salt: neither
        shalt thou take away the salt of the covenant of thy God from thy sacrifice.
        In all thy oblations thou shalt offer salt.'
      - 'But if thou offer a gift of the firstfruits of thy corn to the Lord, of the
        ears yet green, thou shalt dry it at the fire, and break it small like meal;
        and so shalt thou offer thy firstfruits to the Lord:'
      - Pouring oil upon it and putting on frankincense, because it is the oblation
        of the Lord.
      - Whereof the priest shall burn for a memorial of the gift, part of the corn
        broken small and of the oil, and all the frankincense.

        instances:
          - note: Peace, in the scripture language, signifies happiness, welfare or
              prosperity; in a word, all kind of blessings.—Such sacrifices, therefore,
              as were offered either on occasion of blessings received, or to obtain
              new favours, were called pacific or peace offerings. In these, some
              part of the victim was consumed with fire on the altar of God; other
              parts were eaten by the priests and by the persons for whom the sacrifice
              was offered.

        in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony: and the sons of Aaron the
        priests shall pour the blood round about upon the altar.'

        to the Lord: the fat that covereth the entrails, and all the fat that is within,'

        he offer male or female, they shall be without blemish.

        of the liver with the little kidneys.

      - 'He shall put his hand upon the head thereof: and shall immolate it in the
        entry of the tabernacle of the testimony. And the sons of Aaron shall pour
        the blood thereof round about upon the altar.'
      - 'And they shall take of it for the food of the Lord’s fire, the fat that covereth
        the belly, and that covereth all the vital parts:'
      - The two little kidneys with the caul that is upon them which is by the flanks,
        and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys.
      - And the priest shall burn them upon the altar, for the food of the fire, and
        of a most sweet savour. All the fat shall be the Lord’s.

        doth any thing concerning any of the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded
        not to be done:'
      - If the priest that is anointed shall sin, making the people to offend, he
        shall offer to the Lord for his sin a calf without blemish.

        put his hand upon the head thereof, and shall sacrifice it to the Lord.'

        times before the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary.
      - And he shall put some of the same blood upon the horns of the altar of the
        sweet incense most acceptable to the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the
        testimony. And he shall pour all the rest of the blood at the foot of the

        a pile of wood. They shall be burnt in the place where the ashes are poured
        out.'
      - And if all the multitude of Israel shall be ignorant, and through ignorance
        shall do that which is against the commandment of the Lord,

        a calf, and shall bring it to the door of the tabernacle.'

        left, he shall let it drop at the bottom thereof, because it is for sin.'
      - And the other he shall burn for a holocaust, as is wont to be done. And the
        priest shall pray for him, and for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
      - And if his hand be not able to offer two turtles, or two young pigeons, he
        shall offer for his sin the tenth part of an ephi of flour. He shall not put

        putting wood on it every day in the morning: and laying on the holocaust,
        shall burn thereupon the fat of the peace offerings.'
      - This is the perpetual fire which shall never go out on the altar.

        Lord, offering for the sacrifice of every one of them flour tempered with
        oil: for to day the Lord will appear to you.'

        of the tabernacle: where when all the multitude stood,'
      - 'Moses said: This is the word, which the Lord hath commanded. Do it, and his
        glory will appear to you.'
      - 'And he said to Aaron: Approach to the altar, and offer sacrifice for thy
        sin. Offer the holocaust, and pray for thyself and for the people: and when
        thou hast slain the people’s victim, pray for them, as the Lord hath commanded.'
      - And forthwith Aaron, approaching to the altar, immolated the calf for his
        sin.

        and touched the horns of the altar, and poured the rest at the foot thereof.'

        the members: all which he burnt with fire upon the altar.'

        the altar,'

      - The fat also of the bullock, and the rump of the ram, and the two little kidneys
        with their fat, and the caul of the liver,

      - Aaron separated their breasts, and the right shoulders, elevating them before
        the Lord, as Moses had commanded.
      - And stretching forth his hands to the people, he blessed them. And so the
        victims for sin, and the holocausts, and the peace offerings being finished,
        he came down.
      - And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony, and afterwards
        came forth and blessed the people. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all

      - 'And you shall eat it in a holy place: which is given to thee and thy sons
        of the oblations of the Lord, as it hath been commanded me.'
      - The breast also that is offered, and the shoulder that is separated, you shall
        eat in a most clean place, thou and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee.
        For they are set aside for thee and thy children, of the victims of peace
        offerings of the children of Israel.

        holy, and given to you, that you may bear the iniquity of the people, and
        may pray for them in the sight of the Lord.

        to the days of separation of her flowers.'
      - 'And on the eighth day the infant shall be circumcised:'

    verse:
      - ~
      - 'And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:'
      - The man in whose skin or flesh shall arise a different colour or a blister,
        or as it were something shining, that is the stroke of the leprosy, shall
        be brought to Aaron the priest, or any one of his sons.
      - 'And if he see the leprosy in his skin, and the hair turned white and the
        place where the leprosy appears lower than the skin and the rest of the flesh:
        it is the stroke of the leprosy, and upon his judgment he shall be separated.'
      - But if there be a shining whiteness in the skin, and not lower than the other
        flesh, and the hair be of the former colour, the priest shall shut him up
        seven days.
      - 'And the seventh day he shall look on him: and if the leprosy be grown no
        farther, and hath not spread itself in the skin, he shall shut him up again
        other seven days.'
      - 'And on the seventh day, he shall look on him. If the leprosy be somewhat
        obscure, and not spread in the skin, he shall declare him clean, because it
        is but a scab: and the man shall wash his clothes, and shall be clean.'
      - 'But, if the leprosy grow again, after he was seen by the priest and restored
        to cleanness, he shall be brought to him:'
      - And shall be condemned of uncleanness.
      - 'If the stroke of the leprosy be in a man, he shall be brought to the priest:'
      - 'And he shall view him. And when there shall be a white colour in the skin,
        and it shall have changed the look of the hair, and the living flesh itself
        shall appear:'
      - 'It shall be judged an inveterate leprosy, and grown into the skin. The priest
        therefore shall declare him unclean: and shall not shut him up, because he
        is evidently unclean.'
      - 'But if the leprosy spring out running about in the skin, and cover all the
        skin from the head to the feet, whatsoever falleth under the sight of the
        eyes:'
      - 'The priest shall view him, and shall judge that the leprosy which he has
        is very clean: because it is all turned into whiteness, and therefore the
        man shall be clean.'
      - 'But when the live flesh shall appear in him:'
      - Then by the judgment of the priest he shall be defiled, and shall be reckoned
        among the unclean. For live flesh, if it be spotted with leprosy, is unclean.
      - 'And if again it be turned into whiteness, and cover all the man:'
      - The priest shall view him, and shall judge him to be clean.
      - 'When also there has been an ulcer in the flesh and the skin, and it has been
        healed:'
      - And in the place of the ulcer, there appeareth a white scar, or somewhat red,
        the man shall be brought to the priest.
      - 'And when he shall see the place of the leprosy lower than the other flesh,
        and the hair turned white: he shall declare him unclean, for the plague of
        leprosy is broken out in the ulcer.'
      - 'But if the hair be of the former colour, and the scar somewhat obscure, and
        be not lower than the flesh that is near it: he shall shut him up seven days.'
      - 'And if it spread, he shall judge him to have the leprosy:'
      - 'But if it stay in its place, it is but the scar of an ulcer: and the man
        shall be clean.'
      - 'The flesh also and skin that hath been burnt, and after it is healed hath
        a white or a red scar:'
      - 'The priest shall view it, and if he see it turned white, and the place thereof
        is lower than the other skin: he shall declare him unclean, because the evil
        of leprosy is broken out in the scar.'
      - 'But if the colour of the hair be not changed, nor the blemish lower than
        the other flesh, and the appearance of the leprosy be somewhat obscure: he
        shall shut him up seven days,'
      - And on the seventh day he shall view him. If the leprosy be grown farther
        in the skin, he shall declare him unclean.
      - 'But if the whiteness stay in its place, and be not very clear, it is the
        sore of a burning: and therefore he shall be cleansed, because it is only
        the scar of a burning.'
      - If the leprosy break out in the head or the beard of a man or woman, the priest
        shall see them,
      - 'And if the place be lower than the other flesh, and the hair yellow, and
        thinner than usual: he shall declare them unclean, because it is the leprosy
        of the head and the beard;'
      - 'But if he perceive the place of the spot is equal with the flesh that is
        near it, and the hair black: he shall shut him up seven days,'
      - 'And on the seventh day he shall look upon it. If the spot be not grown, and
        the hair keep its colour, and the place of the blemish be even with the other
        flesh:'
      - 'The man shall be shaven all but the place of the spot: and he shall be shut
        up other seven days.'
      - 'If on the seventh day the evil seem to have stayed in its place, and not
        lower than the other flesh, he shall cleanse him: and his clothes being washed
        he shall be clean.'
      - 'But if after his cleansing the spot spread again in the skin:'
      - He shall seek no more whether the hair be turned yellow, because he is evidently
        unclean.
      - 'But if the spot be stayed, and the hair be black, let him know that the man
        is healed: and let him confidently pronounce him clean.'
      - If a whiteness appear in the skin of a man or a woman,
      - The priest shall view them. If he find that a darkish whiteness shineth in
        the skin, let him know that it is not the leprosy, but a white blemish, and
        that the man is clean.
      - 'The man whose hair falleth off from his head, he is bald and clean:'
      - And if the hair fall from his forehead, he is bald before and clean.
      - 'But if in the bald head or in the bald forehead there be risen a white or
        reddish colour:'
      - And the priest perceive this, he shall condemn him undoubtedly of leprosy
        which is risen in the bald part.
      - 'Now whosoever shall be defiled with the leprosy, and is separated by the
        judgment of the priest:'
      - 'Shall have his clothes hanging loose, his head bare, his mouth covered with
        a cloth: and he shall cry out that he is defiled and unclean.'
      - All the time that he is a leper and unclean he shall dwell alone without the
        camp.
      - A woollen or linen garment that shall have the leprosy
      - 'In the warp, and the woof: or skin, or whatsoever is made of a skin:'
      - If it be infected with a white or red spot, it shall be accounted the leprosy,
        and shall be shewn to the priest.
      - And he shall look upon it and shall shut it up seven days.
      - And on the seventh day when he looketh on it again, if he find that it is
        grown, it is a fixed leprosy. He shall judge the garment unclean, and every
        thing wherein it shall be found.
      - And therefore it shall be burnt with fire.
      - But if he see that it is not grown,
      - 'He shall give orders, and they shall wash that part wherein the leprosy is:
        and he shall shut it up other seven days.'
      - 'And when he shall see that the former colour is not returned, nor yet the
        leprosy spread, he shall judge it unclean: and shall burn it with fire, for
        the leprosy has taken hold of the outside of the garment, or through the whole.'
      - But if the place of the leprosy be somewhat dark, after the garment is washed,
        he shall tear it off, and divide it from that which is sound.
      - 'And if after this there appear in those places that before were without spot,
        a flying and wandering leprosy: it must be burnt with fire.'
      - 'If it cease, he shall wash with water the parts that are pure, the second
        time: and they shall be clean.'
      - 'This is the law touching the leprosy of any woollen or linen garment, either
        in the warp or woof, or any thing of skins: how it ought to be cleaned, or
        pronounced unclean.'

              and very significative. The sprinkling seven times with the blood of
              the little bird, the washing himself and his clothes, the shaving his
              hair and his beard, signify the means which are to be used in the reconciliation
              of a sinner, and the steps by which he is to return to God, viz., by
              the repeated application of the blood of Christ: the washing his conscience
              with the waters of compunction: and retrenching all vanities and superfluities,
              by employing all that is over and above what is necessary in alms deeds.
              The sin offering, and the holocaust or burnt offering, which he was

              heart, and that of adoration in spirit and truth, with gratitude and
              thankfulness, for the forgiveness of sins, with which we are ever to
              appear before the Almighty. The touching the right ear, the thumb of
              the right hand, and the great toe of the right foot, first with the
              blood of the victim, and then with the remainder of the oil, which had
              been sprinkled seven times before the Lord, signify the application
              of the blood of Christ, and the unction of the sevenfold grace of the
              Holy Ghost; to the sinner’s right ear, that he may duly hearken to and
              obey the law of God; and to his right hand and foot, that the works
              of his hands, and all the steps or affections of his soul, signified

      - 'This is the rite of a leper, when he is to be cleansed. He shall be brought
        to the priest:'
      - Who going out of the camp, when he shall find that the leprosy is cleansed,
      - Shall command him that is to be purified, to offer for himself two living
        sparrows, which it is lawful to eat, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
      - And he shall command one of the sparrows to be immolated in an earthen vessel
        over living waters.
      - 'But the other that is alive, he shall dip, with the cedar wood, and the scarlet
        and the hyssop, in the blood of the sparrow that is immolated:'
      - Wherewith he shall sprinkle him that is to be cleansed seven times, that he
        may be rightly purified. And he shall let go the living sparrow, that it may
        fly into the field.
      - 'And when the man hath washed his clothes, he shall shave all the hair of
        his body, and shall be washed with water: and being purified he shall enter
        into the camp, yet so that he tarry without his own tent seven days.'
      - And on the seventh day he shall shave the hair of his head, and his beard
        and his eyebrows, and the hair of all his body. And having washed again his
        clothes, and his body,
      - On the eighth day, he shall take two lambs without blemish, and an ewe of
        a year old without blemish, and three tenths of flour tempered with oil for
        a sacrifice, and a sextary of oil apart.
      - 'And when the priest that purifieth the man, hath presented him, and all these
        things before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony:'
      - He shall take a lamb, and offer it for a trespass offering with the sextary
        of oil. And having offered all before the Lord,
      - 'He shall immolate the lamb, where the victim for sin is wont to be immolated,
        and the holocaust, that is, in the holy place. For as that which is for sin,
        so also the victim for a trespass offering pertaineth to the priest: it is
        holy of holies.'
      - And the priest taking of the blood of the victim that was immolated for trespass,
        shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon
        the thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot.
      - And he shall pour of the sextary of oil into his own left hand,
      - And shall dip his right finger in it, and sprinkle it before the Lord seven
        times.
      - 'And the rest of the oil in his left hand, he shall pour upon the tip of the
        right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand and
        the great toe of his right foot, and upon the blood that was shed for trespass:'
      - And upon his head.
      - And he shall pray for him before the Lord, and shall offer the sacrifice for
        sin. Then shall he immolate the holocaust.
      - 'And put it on the altar with the libations thereof: and the man shall be
        rightly cleansed.'
      - 'But if he be poor, and his hand cannot find the things aforesaid: he shall
        take a lamb for an offering for trespass, that the priest may pray for him,
        and a tenth part of flour tempered with oil for a sacrifice, and a sextary
        of oil:'
      - And two turtles or two young pigeons, of which one may be for sin, and the
        other for a holocaust.
      - And he shall offer them on the eighth day of his purification to the priest,
        at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the Lord.
      - And the priest receiving the lamb for trespass, and the sextary of oil, shall
        elevate them together.
      - And the lamb being immolated, he shall put of the blood thereof upon the tip
        of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right
        hand, and the great toe of his right foot.
      - But he shall pour part of the oil into his own left hand,
      - And dipping the finger of his right hand in it, he shall sprinkle it seven
        times before the Lord.
      - And he shall touch the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and the
        thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot, in the place
        of the blood that was shed for trespass.
      - And the other part of the oil that is in his left hand, he shall pour upon
        the head of the purified person, that he may appease the Lord for him.
      - 'And he shall offer a turtle, or young pigeon:'
      - One for trespass, and the other for a holocaust, with their libations.
      - This is the sacrifice of a leper, that is not able to have all things that
        appertain to his cleansing.
      - 'And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:'
      - 'When you shall come into the land of Chanaan, which I will give you for a
        possession, if there be the plague of leprosy in a house:'
      - 'He whose house it is, shall go and tell the priest, saying: It seemeth to
        me, that there is the plague of leprosy in my house,'
      - And he shall command, that they carry forth all things out of the house, before
        he go into it, and see whether it have the leprosy, let all things become
        unclean that are in the house. And afterwards he shall go in to view the leprosy
        of the house.
      - 'And if he see in the walls thereof as it were little dints, disfigured with
        paleness or redness, and lower than all he rest:'
      - He shall go out of the door of the house, and forthwith shut it up seven days,
      - And returning on the seventh day, he shall look upon it. If he find that the
        leprosy is spread,
      - 'He shall command, that the stones wherein the leprosy is, be taken out, and
        cast without the city into an unclean place:'
      - 'And that the house be scraped on the inside round about, and the dust of
        the scrapings be scattered without the city into an unclean place:'
      - And that other stones be laid in the place of them that were taken away, and
        the house be plastered with other mortar.
      - But if after the stones be taken out, and the dust scraped off, and it be
        plastered with other earth.
      - The priest going in perceive that the leprosy is returned, and the walls full
        of spots, it is a lasting leprosy, and the house is unclean.
      - And they shall destroy it forthwith, and shall cast the stones and timber
        thereof, and all the dust without the town into an unclean place.
      - He that entereth into the house when it is shut, shall be unclean until evening,
      - And he that sleepeth in it, and eateth any thing, shall wash his clothes.
      - But if the priest going in perceive that the leprosy is not spread in the
        house, after it was plastered again, he shall purify it, it being cured.
      - And for the purification thereof he shall take two sparrows, and cedar wood,
        and scarlet, and hyssop.
      - And having immolated one sparrow in an earthen vessel, over living waters,
      - 'He shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living

        shall set them from evening until morning before the Lord, by a perpetual
        service and rite in your generations.
      - They shall be set upon the most pure candlestick before the Lord continually.
      - Thou shalt take also fine flour, and shalt bake twelve loaves thereof, two
        tenths shall be in every loaf.
      - And thou shalt set them six and six, one against another, upon the most clean
        table before the Lord.
      - And thou shalt put upon them the clearest frankincense, that the bread may
        be for a memorial of the oblation of the Lord.
      - 'Every sabbath they shall be changed before the Lord: being received of the
        children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.'
      - 'And they shall be Aaron’s and his sons’, that they may eat them in the holy
        place: because it is most holy of the sacrifices of the Lord by a perpetual

      - 'And behold there went out the son of a woman of Israel, whom she had of an
        Egyptian, among the children of Israel: and fell at words in the camp with
        a man of Israel.'
      - And when he had blasphemed the name, and had cursed it, he was brought to
        Moses. (Now his mother was called Salumith, the daughter of Dabri, of the
        tribe of Dan.)
      - And they put him into prison, till they might know what the Lord would command.
      - And the Lord spoke to Moses,
      - 'Saying: Bring forth the blasphemer without the camp: and let them that heard
        him, put their hands upon his head: and let all the people stone him.'
      - 'And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel: The man that curseth his
        God, shall bear his sin:'
      - And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die. All the multitude
        shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger. He that blasphemeth
        the name of the Lord, dying let him die.
      - 'He that striketh and killeth a man: dying let him die.'

        he gave, the like shall he be compelled to suffer.

    verse:
      - ~
      - 'And the Lord spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying:'
      - 'Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you shall
        have entered into the land which I will give you, observe the rest of the
        sabbath of the Lord.'
      - Six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard,
        and shalt gather the fruits thereof.
      - But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath to the land, of the resting
        of the Lord. Thou shalt not sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
      - 'What the ground shall bring forth of itself, thou shalt not reap: neither
        shalt thou gather the grapes or the firstfruits as a vintage. For it is a
        year of rest to the land.'
      - But they shall be unto you for meat, to thee and to thy manservant, to thy
        maidservant and thy hireling, and to the strangers that sojourn with thee.
      - All things that grow shall be meat to thy beasts and to thy cattle.
      - 'Thou shalt also number to thee seven weeks of years: that is to say, seven
        times seven, which together make forty-nine years.'
      - And thou shalt sound the trumpet in the seventh month, the tenth day of the
        month, in the time of the expiation in all your land.
      - 'And thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year, and shalt proclaim remission to
        all the inhabitants of thy land: for it is the year of jubilee. Every man
        shall return to his possession, and every one shall go back to his former
        family:'
      - Because it is the jubilee and the fiftieth year. You shall not sow, nor reap
        the things that grow in the field of their own accord, neither shall you gather
        the firstfruits of the vines,
      - Because of the sanctification of the jubilee. But as they grow you shall presently
        eat them.
      - In the year of the jubilee all shall return to their possessions.
      - 'When thou shalt sell any thing to thy neighbour, or shalt buy of him: grieve
        not thy brother. But thou shalt buy of him according to the number of years
        from the jubilee.'
      - And he shall sell to thee according to the computation of the fruits.
      - 'The more years remain after the jubilee, the more shall the price increase:
        and the less time is counted, so much the less shall the purchase cost. For
        he shall sell to thee the time of the fruits.'
      - 'Do not afflict your countrymen: but let every one fear his God. Because I
        am the Lord your God.'
      - 'Do my precepts, and keep my judgments, and fulfil them: that you may dwell
        in the land without any fear.'
      - And the ground may yield you its fruits, of which you may eat your fill, fearing
        no man’s invasion.
      - 'But if you say: What shall we eat the seventh year, if we sow not, nor gather
        our fruits?'
      - 'I will give you my blessing the sixth year: and it shall yield the fruits
        of three years.'
      - 'And the eighth year you shall sow, and shall eat of the old fruits, until
        the ninth year: till new grow up, you shall eat the old store.'
      - 'The land also shall not be sold for ever: because it is mine, and you are
        strangers and sojourners with me.'
      - For which cause all the country of your possession shall be under the condition
        of redemption.
      - 'If thy brother being impoverished sell his little possession, and his kinsman
        will: he may redeem what he had sold.'
      - 'But if he have no kinsman, and he himself can find the price to redeem it:'
      - The value of the fruits shall be counted from that time when he sold it. And
        the overplus he shall restore to the buyer, and so shall receive his possession
        again.
      - But if his hands find not the means to repay the price, the buyer shall have
        what he bought, until the year of the jubilee. For in that year all that is
        sold shall return to the owner, and to the ancient possessor.
      - He that selleth a house within the walls of a city, shall have the liberty
        to redeem it, until one year be expired.
      - If he redeem it not, and the whole year be fully out, the buyer shall possess
        it, and his posterity for ever, and it cannot be redeemed, not even in the
        jubilee.
      - But if the house be in a village, that hath no walls, it shall be sold according
        to the same law as the fields. If it be not redeemed before, in the jubilee
        it shall return to the owner.
      - The houses of Levites, which are in cities, may always be redeemed.
      - 'If they be not redeemed, in the jubilee they shall all return to the owners:
        because the houses of the cities of the Levites are for their possessions
        among the children of Israel.'
      - But let not their suburbs be sold, because it is a perpetual possession.
      - 'If thy brother be impoverished, and weak of hand, and thou receive him as
        a stranger and sojourner, and he live with thee:'
      - Take not usury of him nor more than thou gavest. Fear thy God, that thy brother
        may live with thee.
      - 'Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury: nor exact of him any increase
        of fruits.'
      - I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that I might
        give you the land of Chanaan, and might be your God.
      - 'If thy brother constrained by poverty, sell himself to thee: thou shalt not
        oppress him with the service of bondservants.'
      - 'But he shall be as a hireling, and a sojourner: he shall work with thee until
        the year of the jubilee.'
      - 'And afterwards he shall go out with his children: and shall return to his
        kindred and to the possession of his fathers.'
      - 'For they are my servants, and I brought them out of the land of Egypt: let
        them not be sold as bondmen.'
      - 'Afflict him not by might: but fear thy God.'
      - 'Let your bondmen, and your bondwomen, be of the nations that are round about
        you:'
      - 'And of the strangers that sojourn among you, or that were born of them in
        your land. These you shall have for servants:'
      - And by right of inheritance shall leave them to your posterity, and shall
        possess them for ever. But oppress not your brethren the children of Israel
        by might.
      - 'If the hand of a stranger or a sojourner grow strong among you, and thy brother
        being impoverished sell himself to him, or to any of his race:'
      - 'After the sale he may be redeemed. He that will of his brethren shall redeem
        him:'
      - 'Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, or his kinsman, by blood, or by affinity.
        But if he himself be able also, he shall redeem himself:'
      - 'Counting only the years from the time of his selling unto the year of the
        jubilee: and counting the money that he was sold for, according to the number
        of the years and the reckoning of a hired servant.'
      - If there be many years that remain until the jubilee, according to them shall
        he also repay the price.
      - 'If few, he shall make the reckoning with him according to the number of the
        years: and shall repay to the buyer of what remaineth of the years.'
      - 'His wages being allowed for which he served before: he shall not afflict
        him violently in thy sight.'
      - And if by these means he cannot be redeemed, in the year of the jubilee he
        shall go out with his children.
      - For the children of Israel are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the
        land of Egypt.

      punishments with which he threatens transgressors.
    chapter_number: 26
    verse:
      - ~
      - 'I am the Lord your God. You shall not make to yourselves any idol or graven
        thing: neither shall you erect pillars, nor set up a remarkable stone in your
        land, to adore it. For I am the Lord your God.'
      - Keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary. I am the Lord.
      - If you walk in my precepts, and keep my commandments, and do them, I will
        give you rain in due seasons.
      - 'And the ground shall bring forth its increase: and the trees shall be filled
        with fruit.'
      - 'The threshing of your harvest shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage
        shall reach unto the sowing time: and you shall eat your bread to the full,
        and dwell in your land without fear.'
      - 'I will give peace in your coasts: you shall sleep, and there shall be none
        to make you afraid. I will take away evil beasts: and the sword shall not
        pass through your quarters.'
      - 'You shall pursue your enemies: and they shall fall before you.'
      - 'Five of yours shall pursue a hundred others: and a hundred of you ten thousand.
        Your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.'
      - 'I will look on you, and make you increase: you shall be multiplied, and I
        will establish my covenant with you.'
      - 'You shall eat the oldest of the old store: and, new coming on, you shall
        cast away the old.'
      - 'I will set my tabernacle in the midst of you: and my soul shall not cast
        you off.'
      - 'I will walk among you, and will be your God: and you shall be my people.'
      - 'I am the Lord your God: who have brought you out of the land of the Egyptians,
        that you should not serve them: and who have broken the chains of your necks,
        that you might go upright.'
      - 'But if you will not hear me, nor do all my commandments:'
      - 'If you despise my laws, and contemn my judgments so as not to do those things
        which are appointed by me, and to make void my covenant:'
      - I also will do these things to you. I will quickly visit you with poverty,
        and burning heat, which shall waste your eyes, and consume your lives. You
        shall sow your seed in vain, which shall be devoured by your enemies.
      - 'I will set my face against you, and you shall fall down before your enemies:
        and shall be made subject to them that hate you. You shall flee when no man
        pursueth you.'
      - 'But if you will not yet for all this obey me: I will chastise you seven times
        more for your sins.'
      - 'And I will break the pride of your stubbornness: and I will make to you the
        heaven above as iron, and the earth as brass.'
      - 'Your labour shall be spent in vain: the ground shall not bring forth her
        increase: nor the trees yield their fruit.'
      - If you walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring seven
        times more plagues upon you for your sins.
      - 'And I will send in upon you the beasts of the field, to destroy you and your
        cattle, and make you few in number: and that your highways may be desolate.'
      - 'And if even so you will not amend, but will walk contrary to me:'
      - I also will walk contrary to you, and will strike you seven times for your
        sins.
      - And I will bring in upon you the sword that shall avenge my covenant. And
        when you shall flee into the cities, I will send the pestilence in the midst
        of you. And you shall be delivered into the hands of your enemies,
      - 'After I shall have broken the staff of your bread: so that ten women shall
        bake your bread in one oven, and give it out by weight: and you shall eat,
        and shall not be filled,'
      - But if you will not for all this hearken to me, but will walk against me,
      - 'I will also go against you with opposite fury: and I will chastise you with
        seven plagues for your sins,'
      - So that you shall eat the flesh of your sons and of your daughters.
      - I will destroy your high places, and break your idols. You shall fall among
        the ruins of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
      - 'Insomuch that I will bring your cities to be a wilderness: and I will make
        your sanctuaries desolate: and will receive no more your sweet odours.'
      - 'And I will destroy your land: and your enemies shall be astonished at it,
        when they shall be the inhabitants thereof.'
      - 'And I will scatter you among the Gentiles: and I will draw out the sword
        after you. And your land shall be desert, and your cities destroyed.'
      - Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths all the days of her desolation. When
        you shall be
      - 'In the enemy’s land, she shall keep a sabbath, and rest in the sabbaths of
        her desolation: because she did not rest in your sabbaths, when you dwelt
        therein.'
      - 'And as to them that shall remain of you I will send fear in their hearts
        in the countries of their enemies. The sound of a flying leaf shall terrify
        them: and they shall flee as it were from the sword. They shall fall, when
        no man pursueth them.'
      - 'And they shall every one fall upon their brethren as fleeing from wars: none
        of you shall dare to resist your enemies.'
      - 'You shall perish among the Gentiles: and an enemy’s land shall consume you.'
      - 'And if of them also some remain, they shall pine away in their iniquities,
        in the land of their enemies: and they shall be afflicted for the sins of
        their fathers, and their own.'
      - Until they confess their iniquities, and the iniquities of their ancestors,
        whereby they have transgressed against me, and walked contrary unto me.
      - Therefore I also will walk against them, and bring them into their enemies’
        land until their uncircumcised mind be ashamed. Then shall they pray for their
        sins.
      - 'And I will remember my covenant, that I made with Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham.
        I will remember also the land:'
      - Which when she shall be left by them, shall enjoy her sabbaths, being desolate
        for them. But they shall pray for their sins, because they rejected my judgments,
        and despised my laws.
      - 'And yet for all that when they were in the land of their enemies, I did not
        cast them off altogether. Neither did I so despise them that they should be
        quite consumed: and I should make void my covenant with them. For I am the
        Lord their God.'
      - And I will remember my former covenant, when I brought them out of the land
        of Egypt, in the sight of the Gentiles, to be their God. I am the Lord. These
        are the judgments, and precepts, and laws, which the Lord gave between him
        and the children of Israel, in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.
  - chapter_intro: Of vows and tithes.
    chapter_number: 27
    verse:
      - ~
      - 'And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:'
      - 'Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man that
        shall have made a vow, and promised his soul to God, shall give the price
        according to estimation.'
      - 'If it be a man from twenty years old unto sixty years old, he shall give
        fifty sicles of silver, after the weight of the sanctuary:'
      - If a woman, thirty.
      - 'But from the fifth year until the twentieth, a man shall give twenty sicles:
        a woman ten.'
      - 'From one month until the fifth year, for a male shall be given five sicles:
        for a female three.'
      - 'A man that is sixty years old or upward, shall give fifteen sicles: a woman
        ten.'
      - 'If he be poor, and not able to pay the estimation, he shall stand before
        the priest: and as much as he shall value him at, and see him able to pay,
        so much shall he give.'
      - But a beast that may be sacrificed to the Lord, if any one shall vow, shall
        be holy,
      - 'And cannot be changed: that is to say, neither a better for a worse, nor
        a worse for a better. And if he shall change it: both that which was changed,
        and that for which it was changed, shall be consecrated to the Lord.'
      - 'An unclean beast, which cannot be sacrificed to the Lord, if any man shall
        vow, shall be brought before the priest:'
      - Who judging whether it be good or bad, shall set the price.
      - Which, if he that offereth it will give, he shall add above the estimation
        the fifth part.
      - 'If a man shall vow his house, and sanctify it to the Lord, the priest shall
        consider it, whether it be good or bad: and it shall be sold according to
        the price, which he shall appoint.'
      - 'But if he that vowed, will redeem it, he shall give the fifth part of the
        estimation over and above: and shall have the house.'
      - And if he vow the field of his possession, and consecrate it to the Lord,
        the price shall be rated according to the measure of the seed. If the ground
        be sown with thirty bushels of barley, let it be sold for fifty sicles of
        silver.
      - 'If he vow his field immediately from the year of jubilee that is beginning:
        as much as it may be worth, at so much it shall be rated.'
      - But if some time after, the priest shall reckon the money according to the
        number of years that remain until the jubilee, and the price shall be abated.
      - And if he that had vowed, will redeem his field, he shall add the fifth part
        of the money of the estimation, and shall possess it.
      - And if he will not redeem it, but it be sold to any other man, he that vowed
        it, may not redeem it any more.
      - For when the day of jubilee cometh, it shall be sanctified to the Lord, and
        as a possession consecrated, pertaineth to the right of the priest.
      - 'If a field that was bought, and not of a man’s ancestors’ possession, be
        sanctified to the Lord:'
      - The priest shall reckon the price according to the number of years, unto the
        jubilee. And he that had vowed, shall give that to the Lord.
      - But in the jubilee, it shall return to the former owner, who had sold it,
        and had it in the lot of his possession.
      - All estimation shall be made according to the sicle of the sanctuary. A sicle
        hath twenty obols.
      - 'The firstborn, which belong to the Lord, no man may sanctify and vow: whether
        it be bullock, or sheep, they are the Lord’s.'
      - And if it be an unclean beast, he that offereth it shall redeem it, according
        to thy estimation, and shall add the fifth part of the price. If he will not
        redeem it, it shall be sold to another for how much soever it was estimated
        by thee.
      - 'Any thing that is devoted to the Lord, whether it be man, or beast, or field,
        shall not be sold: neither may it be redeemed. Whatsoever is once consecrated
        shall be holy of holies to the Lord.'
      - And any consecration that is offered by man, shall not be redeemed, but dying
        shall die.
      - All tithes of the land, whether of corn, or of the fruits of trees, are the
        Lord’s, and are sanctified to him.
      - And if any man will redeem his tithes, he shall add the fifth part of them.
      - Of all the tithes of oxen, and sheep, and goats, that pass under the shepherd’s
        rod, every tenth that cometh shall be sanctified to the Lord.
      - 'It shall not be chosen neither good nor bad, neither shall it be changed
        for another. If any man change it: both that which was changed, and that for
        which it was changed, shall be sanctified to the Lord, and shall not be redeemed.'
      - These are the precepts which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of
        Israel in mount Sinai.
