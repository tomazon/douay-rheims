book_intro: The first Epistle of St. Peter, though brief, contains much doctrine concerning
  Faith, Hope, and Charity, with divers instructions to all persons of what state
  or condition soever. The Apostle commands submission to rulers and superiors and
  exhorts all to the practice of a virtuous life in imitation, of Christ. This Epistle
  is written with such apostolical dignity as to manifest the supreme authority with
  which its writer, the Prince of the Apostles, had been vested by his Lord and Master,
  Jesus Christ. He wrote it at Rome, which figuratively he calls Babylon, about fifteen
  years after our Lord’s Ascension.

    verse:
      - ~
      - Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers dispersed through Pontus,
        Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, elect,
      - According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, unto the sanctification
        of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
        Grace unto you and peace be multiplied.
      - 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to
        his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by the resurrection
        of Jesus Christ from the dead:'
      - Unto an inheritance, incorruptible, and undefiled and that cannot fade, reserved
        in heaven for you,
      - Who, by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed
        in the last time.
      - 'Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little time made
        sorrowful in divers temptations:'
      - That the trial of your faith (much more precious than gold which is tried
        by the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing
        of Jesus Christ.
      - 'Whom having not seen, you love: in whom also now though you see him not,
        you believe and, believing, shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorified;'
      - Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.
      - Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently searched, who
        prophesied of the grace to come in you.
      - Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did signify,
        when it foretold those sufferings that are in Christ and the glories that
        should follow.
      - 'To whom it was revealed that, not to themselves but to you, they ministered
        those things which are now declared to you by them that have preached the
        gospel to you: the Holy Ghost being sent down from heaven, on whom the angels
        desire to look.'
      - Wherefore, having the loins of your mind girt up, being sober, trust perfectly
        in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of Jesus Christ.
      - As children of obedience, not fashioned according to the former desires of
        your ignorance,
      - 'But according to him that hath called you, who is holy, be you also in all
        manner of conversation holy:'
      - 'Because it is written: You shall be holy, for I am holy.'
      - 'And if you invoke as Father him who, without respect of persons, judgeth
        according to every one’s work: converse in fear during the time of your sojourning
        here.'
      - 'Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as gold or silver,
        from your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers:'
      - But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled.
      - 'Foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but manifested in the
        last times for you:'
      - Who through him are faithful in God who raised him up from the dead and hath
        given him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.
      - 'Purifying your souls in the obedience of charity, with a brotherly love,
        from a sincere heart love one another earnestly:'
      - Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by the word
        of God who liveth and remaineth for ever.
      - For all flesh is as grass and all the glory thereof as the flower of grass.
        The grass is withered and the flower thereof is fallen away.
      - But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by
        the gospel hath been preached unto you.
  - chapter_intro: We are to lay aside all guile and go to Christ the living stone,
      and, as being now his people, walk worthily of him, with submission to superiors
      and patience under sufferings.

    verse:
      - ~
      - Wherefore laying away all malice and all guile and dissimulations and envies
        and all detractions,
      - 'As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you
        may grow unto salvation:'
      - If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.
      - 'Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men but chosen
        and made honourable by God:'
      - Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood,
        to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
      - 'Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner
        stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him shall not be confounded.'
      - 'To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not,
        the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:'
      - And a stone of stumbling and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at the
        word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.
      - 'But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased
        people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness
        into his marvelous light:'
      - 'Who in time past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had
        not obtained mercy: but now have obtained mercy.'
      - Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves
        from carnal desires which war against the soul,
      - 'Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak
        against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works which they shall behold
        in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.'
      - 'Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God’s sake: whether it
        be to the king as excelling,'
      - Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the
        praise of the good.
      - 'For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the
        ignorance of foolish men:'
      - As free and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants
        of God.
      - Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
      - Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and
        gentle but also to the froward.
      - 'For this is thankworthy: if, for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows,
        suffering wrongfully.'
      - 'For what glory is it, if, committing sin and being buffeted for it, you endure?
        But if doing well you suffer patiently: this is thankworthy before God.'
      - 'For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving
        you an example that you should follow his steps.'
      - Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.
      - 'Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened
        not, but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly.'
      - 'Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being
        dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed.'
      - 'For you were as sheep going astray: but you are now converted to the shepherd
        and bishop of your souls.'

              dispositions in the party, to answer the interrogations made at that
              time, with relation to faith, the renouncing of Satan with all his works;

      - 'In like manner also, let wives be subject to their husbands: that, if any
        believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation
        of the wives,'
      - Considering your chaste conversation with fear.
      - 'Whose adorning, let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing
        of gold, or the putting on of apparel:'
      - But the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a
        meek spirit which is rich in the sight of God.
      - 'For after this manner heretofore, the holy women also who trusted in God
        adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:'
      - 'As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing
        well and not fearing any disturbance.'
      - 'Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge, giving honour
        to the female as to the weaker vessel and as to the co-heirs of the grace
        of life: that your prayers be not hindered.'
      - 'And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being
        lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble:'
      - 'Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing:
        for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a blessing.'
      - For he that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from
        evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.
      - 'Let him decline from evil and do good: Let him seek after peace and pursue
        it:'
      - Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their prayers
        but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things.
      - And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good?
      - 'But if also you suffer any thing for justice’ sake, blessed are ye. And be
        not afraid of their fear: and be not troubled.'
      - But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy
        every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you.
      - 'But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak
        evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation
        in Christ.'
      - For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer than doing
        ill.
      - 'Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that
        he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened
        in the spirit,'
      - 'In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison:'

        God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is,
        eight souls, were saved by water.'
      - 'Whereunto baptism, being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting
        away of the filth of the flesh, but, the examination of a good conscience

        virtues being made subject to him.'

      - That now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh, not after the desires
        of men but according to the will of God.
      - For the time past is sufficient to have fulfilled the will of the Gentiles,
        for them who have walked in riotousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings,
        banquetings and unlawful worshipping of idols.
      - 'Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them into the same confusion
        of riotousness: speaking evil of you.'
      - Who shall render account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
      - 'For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to the dead: That they might
        be judged indeed according to men, in the flesh: but may live according to
        God, in the Spirit.'
      - But the end of all is at hand. Be prudent therefore and watch in prayers.

        charity covereth a multitude of sins.'
      - Using hospitality one towards another, without murmuring,

        and ever. Amen.'
      - 'Dearly beloved, think not strange the burning heat which is to try you: as

      - But if you partake of the sufferings of Christ, rejoice that, when his glory
        shall be revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.
      - 'If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you shall be blessed: for that
        which is of the honour, glory and power of God, and that which is his Spirit
        resteth upon you.'

        of other men’s things.
      - 'But, if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed: but let him glorify God in
        that name.'
      - For the time is, that judgment should begin at the house of God. And if at
        first at us, what shall be the end of them that believe not the gospel of
        God?
      - And if the just man shall scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the
        sinner appear?
      - Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commend their
        souls in good deeds to the faithful Creator.

      - 'Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not by constraint
        but willingly, according to God: not for filthy lucre’s sake but voluntarily:'
      - Neither as lording it over the clergy but being made a pattern of the flock
        from the heart.
      - And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a never fading
        crown of glory.
      - 'In like manner, ye young men, be subject to the ancients. And do you all
        insinuate humility one to another: for God resisteth the proud, but to the
