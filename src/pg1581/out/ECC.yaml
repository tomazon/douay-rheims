      - The words of Ecclesiastes, the son of David, king of Jerusalem.
      - 'Vanity of vanities, said Ecclesiastes: vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.'
      - What hath a man more of all his labour, that he taketh under the sun?
      - 'One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth
        standeth for ever.'
      - 'The sun riseth, and goeth down, and returneth to his place: and there rising
        again,'
      - 'Maketh his round by the south, and turneth again to the north: the spirit
        goeth forward surveying all places round about, and returneth to his circuits.'
      - 'All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea doth not overflow: unto the
        place from whence the rivers come, they return, to flow again.'
      - 'All things are hard: man cannot explain them by word. The eye is not filled
        with seeing, neither is the ear filled with hearing.'
      - What is it that hath been? the same thing that shall be. What is it that hath
        been done? the same that shall be done.
      - 'Nothing under the sun is new, neither is any man able to say: Behold this
        is new: for it hath already gone before in the ages that were before us.'
      - 'There is no remembrance of former things: nor indeed of those things which
        hereafter are to come, shall there be any remembrance with them that shall
        be in the latter end.'
      - I Ecclesiastes was king over Israel in Jerusalem,
      - And I proposed in my mind to seek and search out wisely concerning all things
        that are done under the sun. This painful occupation hath God given to the
        children of men, to be exercised therein.
      - I have seen all things that are done under the sun, and behold all is vanity,
        and vexation of spirit.
      - The perverse are hard to be corrected, and the number of fools is infinite.
      - 'I have spoken in my heart, saying: Behold I am become great, and have gone
        beyond all in wisdom, that were before me in Jerusalem: and my mind hath contemplated
        many things wisely, and I have learned.'
      - 'And I have given my heart to know prudence, and learning, and errors, and
        folly: and I have perceived that in these also there was labour, and vexation
        of spirit,'
      - 'Because in much wisdom there is much indignation: and he that addeth knowledge,
        addeth also labour.'
  - chapter_intro: The vanity of pleasures, riches, and worldly labours.
    chapter_number: 2
    verses:
      - ~
      - 'I said in my heart: I will go, and abound with delights, and enjoy good things.
        And I saw that this also was vanity.'
      - 'Laughter I counted error: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived?'
      - 'I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn
        my mind to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable
        for the children of men: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the
        days of their life.'
      - I made me great works, I built me houses, and planted vineyards,
      - I made gardens, and orchards, and set them with trees of all kinds,
      - And I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood of the young trees,
      - 'I got me menservants, and maidservants, and had a great family: and herds
        of oxen, and great flocks of sheep, above all that were before me in Jerusalem:'
      - 'I heaped together for myself silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and
        provinces: I made me singing men, and singing women, and the delights of the
        sons of men, cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine:'
      - 'And I surpassed in riches all that were before me in Jerusalem: my wisdom
        also remained with me.'
      - 'And whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not: and I withheld not my
        heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting itself in the things which
        I had prepared: and esteemed this my portion, to make use of my own labour.'
      - And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and
        to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity,
        and vexation of mind, and that nothing was lasting under the sun.
      - I passed further to behold wisdom, and errors and folly, (What is man, said
        I that he can follow the King his maker?)
      - And I saw that wisdom excelled folly, as much as light differeth from darkness.
      - 'The eyes of a wise man are in his head: the fool walketh in darkness: and
        I learned that they were to die both alike.'
      - 'And I said in my heart: If the death of the fool and mine shall be one, what
        doth it avail me, that I have applied myself more to the study of wisdom?
        And speaking with my own mind, I perceived that this also was vanity.'
      - 'For there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the fool forever,
        and the times to come shall cover all things together with oblivion: the learned
        dieth in like manner as the unlearned.'
      - And therefore I was weary of my life, when I saw that all things under the
        sun are evil, and all vanity and vexation of spirit.
      - Again I hated all my application wherewith I had earnestly laboured under
        the sun, being like to have an heir after me,
      - 'Whom I know not whether he will be a wise man or a fool, and he shall have
        rule over all my labours with which I have laboured and been solicitous: and
        is there anything so vain?'
      - Wherefore I left off and my heart renounced labouring anymore under the sun.
      - 'For when a man laboureth in wisdom, and knowledge, and carefulness, he leaveth
        what he hath gotten to an idle man: so this also is vanity, and a great evil.'
      - For what profit shall a man have of all his labour, and vexation of spirit,
        with which he hath been tormented under the sun?
      - 'All his days are full of sorrows and miseries, even in the night he doth
        not rest in mind: and is not this vanity?'
      - Is it not better to eat and drink, and to shew his soul good things of his
        labours? and this is from the hand of God.
      - Who shall so feast and abound with delights as I?
      - 'God hath given to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge,
        and joy: but to the sinner he hath given vexation, and superfluous care, to
        heap up and to gather together, and to give it to him that hath pleased God:
        but this also is vanity, and a fruitless solicitude of the mind.'

      on Godâ€™s providence, and cast away fruitless cares.

      - All things have their season, and in their times all things pass under heaven.
      - A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant, and a time to pluck
        up that which is planted.
      - A time to kill, and a time to heal. A time to destroy, and a time to build.
      - A time to weep, and a time to laugh. A time to mourn, and a time to dance.
      - A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather. A time to embrace, and a time

      - What hath man more of his labour?
      - I have seen the trouble, which God hath given the sons of men to be exercised
        in it.
      - He hath made all things good in their time, and hath delivered the world to
        their consideration, so that man cannot find out the work which God hath made
        from the beginning to the end.
      - And I have known that there was no better thing than to rejoice, and to do
        well in this life.

        is the gift of God.
      - 'I have learned that all the works which God hath made, continue for ever:
        we cannot add any thing, nor take away from those things which God hath made
        that he may be feared.'
      - 'That which hath been made, the same continueth: the things that shall be,
        have already been: and God restoreth that which is past.'
      - I saw under the sun in the place of judgment wickedness, and in the place
        of justice iniquity.
      - 'And I said in my heart: God shall judge both the just and the wicked, and
        then shall be the time of every thing.'
      - I said in my heart concerning the sons of men, that God would prove them,
        and shew them to be like beasts.
      - 'Therefore the death of man, and of beasts is one, and the condition of them
        both is equal: as man dieth, so they also die: all things breathe alike, and
        man hath nothing more than beast: all things are subject to vanity.'
      - 'And all things go to one place: of earth they were made, and into earth they
        return together.'
      - Who knoweth if the spirit of the children of Adam ascend upward, and if the
        spirit of the beasts descend downward?
      - And I have found that nothing is better than for a man to rejoice in his work,
        and that this is his portion. For who shall bring him to know the things that
        shall be after him?

      - I turned myself to other things, and I saw the oppressions that are done under

        were not able to resist their violence, being destitute of help from any.

        he ceaseth not to labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches, neither
        doth he reflect, saying: For whom do I labour, and defraud my soul of good
        things? in this also is vanity, and a grievous vexation.'

        wanteth nothing of all that he desireth: yet God doth not give him power to
        eat thereof, but a stranger shall eat it up. This is vanity and a great misery.'
      - 'If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, and attain to a great
        age, and his soul make no use of the goods of his substance, and he be without

      - He that keepeth the commandment, shall find no evil. The heart of a wise man
        understandeth time and answer.
      - 'There is a time and opportunity for every business, and great affliction
        for man:'
      - Because he is ignorant of things past, and things to come he cannot know by
        any messenger.
      - It is not in manâ€™s power to stop the spirit, neither hath he power in the
        day of death, neither is he suffered to rest when war is at hand, neither
        shall wickedness save the wicked.
      - All these things I have considered, and applied my heart to all the works
        that are done under the sun. Sometimes one man ruleth over another to his
        own hurt.
      - 'I saw the wicked buried: who also when they were yet living were in the holy
        place, and were praised in the city as men of just works: but this also is
        vanity.'
      - For because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children
        of men commit evils without any fear.
      - But though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and by patience be borne withal,
        I know from thence that it shall be well with them that fear God, who dread
        his face.
      - But let it not be well with the wicked, neither let his days be prolonged,
        but as a shadow let them pass away that fear not the face of the Lord.
      - 'There is also another vanity, which is done upon the earth. There are just
        men to whom evils happen, as though they had done the works of the wicked:
        and there are wicked men, who are as secure as though they had the deeds of
        the just: but this also I judge most vain.'
      - Therefore I commended mirth, because there was no good for a man under the
        sun, but to eat, and drink, and be merry, and that he should take nothing
        else with him of his labour in the days of his life, which God hath given
        him under the sun.
      - 'And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to understand the distraction
        that is upon earth: for there are some that day and night take no sleep with
        their eyes.'
      - 'And I understood that man can find no reason of all those works of God that
        are done under the sun: and the more he shall labour to seek, so much the
        less shall he find: yea, though the wise man shall say, that he knoweth it,
        he shall not be able to find it.'

      - 'All these things have I considered in my heart, that I might carefully understand
        them: there are just men and wise men, and their works are in the hand of
        God: and yet man knoweth not whether he be worthy of love, or hatred:'
      - 'But all things are kept uncertain for the time to come, because all things
        equally happen to the just and to the wicked, to the good and to the evil,
        to the clean and to the unclean, to him that offereth victims, and to him
        that despiseth sacrifices. As the good is, so also is the sinner: as the perjured,
        so he also that sweareth truth.'
      - 'This is a very great evil among all things that are done under the sun, that
        the same things happen to all men: whereby also the hearts of the children
        of men are filled with evil, and with contempt while they live, and afterwards
        they shall be brought down to hell.'
      - 'There is no man that liveth always, or that hopeth for this: a living dog
        is better than a dead lion.'
      - 'For the living know that they shall die, but the dead know nothing more,
        neither have they a reward any more: for the memory of them is forgotten.'
      - Their love also, and their hatred, and their envy are all perished, neither

      - 'Man knoweth not his own end: but as fishes are taken with the hook, and as
        birds are caught with the snare, so men are taken in the evil time, when it
        shall suddenly come upon them.'
      - 'This wisdom also I have seen under the sun, and it seemed to me to be very
        great:'
      - 'A little city, and few men in it: there came against it a great king, and
        invested it, and built bulwarks round about it, and the siege was perfect.'
      - Now there was found in it a man poor and wise, and he delivered the city by
        his wisdom, and no man afterward remembered that poor man.
      - 'And I said that wisdom is better than strength: how then is the wisdom of
        the poor man slighted, and his words not heard?'
      - The words of the wise are heard in silence, more than the cry of a prince
        among fools.

        lose many good things.'

      - Dying flies spoil the sweetness of the ointment. Wisdom and glory is more
        precious than a small and shortlived folly.
      - The heart of a wise man is in his right hand, and the heart of a fool is in
        his left hand.
      - Yea, and the fool when he walketh in the way, whereas he himself is a fool,
        esteemeth all men fools.
      - 'If the spirit of him that hath power, ascend upon thee, leave not thy place:
        because care will make the greatest sins to cease.'
      - 'There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were by an error proceeding

      - 'The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace: but the lips of a fool shall
        throw him down headlong.'
      - The beginning of his words is folly, and the end of his talk is a mischievous
        error.
      - 'A fool multiplieth words. A man cannot tell what hath been before him: and
        what shall be after him, who can tell him?'
      - The labour of fools shall afflict them that know not how to go to the city.
      - Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and when the princes eat in
        the morning.
      - Blessed is the land, whose king is noble, and whose princes eat in due season
        for refreshment, and not for riotousness.
      - By slothfulness a building shall be brought down, and through the weakness
        of hands, the house shall drop through.
      - 'For laughter they make bread, and wine that the living may feast: and all
        things obey money.'

        man in thy private chamber: because even the birds of the air will carry thy
