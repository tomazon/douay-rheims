book_id: EPH
book_intro: Ephesus was the capital of Lesser Asia, and celebrated for the temple
  of Diana, to which the most part of the people of the East went frequently to worship.
  But St. Paul having preached the Gospel there, for two years the first time and
  afterwards for about a year, converted many. He wrote this Epistle to them when
  he was a prisoner in Rome; and sent it by Tychicus. He admonishes them to hold firmly
  the faith which they had received and warns them, and also those of the neighbouring
  cities, against the sophistry of philosophers and doctrine of false teachers who
  were come among them. The matters of faith contained in this Epistle are exceedingly
  sublime, and consequently very difficult to be understood. It was written about
  twenty-nine years after our Lordâ€™s Ascension.

        good pleasure, which he hath purposed in him,

      - In whom you also, after you had heard the word of truth (the gospel of your
        salvation), in whom also believing, you were signed with the holy Spirit of
        promise.

        you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation, in the knowledge of him:'

        to the operation of the might of his power,

      - Above all principality and power and virtue and dominion and every name that
        is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.
      - And he hath subjected all things under his feet and hath made him head over
        all the church,
      - Which is his body and the fulness of him who is filled all in all.

        the children of unbelief:'
      - 'In which also we all conversed in time past, in the desires of our flesh,
        fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children
        of wrath, even as the rest:'
      - But God (who is rich in mercy) for his exceeding charity wherewith he loved
        us
      - Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together in Christ (by whose
        grace you are saved)

        of Israel and strangers to the testament, having no hope of the promise and
        without God in this world.
      - But now in Christ Jesus, you, who some time were afar off, are made nigh by
        the blood of Christ.
      - 'For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and breaking down the middle
        wall of partition, the enmities in his flesh:'
      - 'Making void the law of commandments contained in decrees: that he might make
        the two in himself into one new man, making peace.'
      - And might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, killing the enmities
        in himself.
      - 'And coming, he preached peace to you that were afar off: and peace to them
        that were nigh.'
      - For by him we have access both in one Spirit to the Father.

      - 'Wherefore he saith: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: he gave
        gifts to men.'
      - Now that he ascended, what is it, but because he also descended first into
        the lower parts of the earth?

      - 'Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children:'
      - And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us and hath delivered himself
        for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.
      - 'But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not so much as
        be named among you, as becometh saints:'
      - 'Or obscenity or foolish talking or scurrility, which is to no purpose: but
        rather giving of thanks.'
      - 'For know you this and understand: That no fornicator or unclean or covetous
        person (which is a serving of idols) hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ
        and of God.'
      - Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh
        the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.
      - Be ye not therefore partakers with them.
      - For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as
        children of the light.
      - 'For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and justice and truth:'
      - Proving what is well pleasing to God.
      - 'And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness: but rather
        reprove them.'
      - For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak
        of.
      - 'But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for all
        that is made manifest is light.'

        to God and the Father:'
      - Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.
      - 'Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:'
      - Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the
        church. He is the saviour of his body.
      - 'Therefore as the church is subject to Christ: so also let the wives be to
        their husbands in all things.'
      - 'Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and delivered
        himself up for it:'
      - 'That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word
        of life:'
      - That he might present it to himself, a glorious church, not having spot or
        wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
      - So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth
        his wife loveth himself.
      - 'For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as
        also Christ doth the church:'
      - Because we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.
      - 'For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother: and shall cleave
        to his wife. And they shall be two in one flesh.'
      - 'This is a great sacrament: but I speak in Christ and in the church.'

        Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.'
      - With a good will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men.
      - Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do, the same shall he receive
        from the Lord, whether he be bond or free.
      - 'And you, masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatenings: knowing
        that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven. And there is no respect of
