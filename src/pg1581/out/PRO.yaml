      - The parables of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel,
      - 'To know wisdom, and instruction:'
      - 'To understand the words of prudence: and to receive the instruction of doctrine,
        justice, and judgment, and equity:'
      - To give subtilty to little ones, to the young man knowledge and understanding.
      - 'A wise man shall hear, and shall be wiser: and he that understandeth shall
        possess governments.'
      - He shall understand a parable and the interpretation, the words of the wise,
        and their mysterious sayings.
      - The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and
        instruction.
      - 'My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy
        mother:'
      - That grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of gold to thy neck.
      - My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them.
      - 'If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide
        snares for the innocent without cause:'
      - Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth down into
        the pit.
      - We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoils.
      - Cast in thy lot with us, let us all have one purse.
      - My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot from their paths.
      - For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
      - But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings.
      - And they themselves lie in wait for their own blood, and practise deceits
        against their own souls.
      - So the ways of every covetous man destroy the souls of the possessors.
      - 'Wisdom preacheth abroad, she uttereth her voice in the streets:'
      - 'At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the gates of
        the city she uttereth her words, saying:'
      - O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things
        which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowledge?
      - 'Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit to you, and will shew
        you my words.'
      - 'Because I called, and you refused: I stretched out my hand, and there was
        none that regarded.'
      - You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions.
      - I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come
        to you which you feared.
      - 'When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction, as a tempest, shall
        be at hand: when tribulation and distress shall come upon you:'
      - 'Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear: they shall rise in the
        morning, and shall not find me:'
      - Because they have hated instruction, and received not the fear of the Lord,
      - Nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my reproof.
      - Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and shall be filled with
        their own devices.
      - The turning away of little ones shall kill them, and the prosperity of fools
        shall destroy them.
      - But he that shall hear me, shall rest without terror, and shall enjoy abundance,
        without fear of evils.

        of the paths of life.
      - 'That thou mayst walk in a good way: and mayst keep the paths of the just.'

        continue in it.

        shall be taken away from it.'

      - My son, attend to my wisdom, and incline thy ear to my prudence,

          - note: 'The sin of theft is not so great, as to be compared with adultery:
              especially when a person pressed with hunger (which is the case here
              spoken of) steals to satisfy nature. Moreover the damage done by theft
              may much more easily be repaired, than the wrong done by adultery. But
              this does not hinder, but that theft also is a mortal sin, forbidden
              by one of the ten commandments.'

        fallen into the hand of thy neighbour. Run about, make haste, stir up thy
        friend:'

      - Deliver thyself as a doe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the
        fowler.
      - 'Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom:'
      - Which, although she hath no guide, nor master, nor captain,
      - Provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the
        harvest.
      - How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
      - 'Thou wilt sleep a little, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy
        hands a little to sleep:'

      - He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with the finger.

      - To such a one his destruction shall presently come, and he shall suddenly
        be destroyed, and shall no longer have any remedy.
      - 'Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh his soul detesteth:'

      - A heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are swift to run into mischief,
      - A deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and him that soweth discord among
        brethren.
      - My son, keep the commandments of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy
        mother.

      - 'When thou walkest, let them go with thee: when thou sleepest, let them keep
        thee, and when thou awakest, talk with them.'
      - 'Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and reproofs of instruction
        are the way of life:'
      - That they may keep thee from the evil woman, and from the flattering tongue
        of the stranger.
      - 'Let not thy heart covet her beauty, be not caught with her winks:'
      - 'For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf: but the woman catcheth the
        precious soul of a man.'
      - Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not burn?

        touch her.
      - 'The fault is not so great when a man hath stolen: for he stealeth to fill
        his hungry soul:'
      - And if he be taken, he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give up all the
        substance of his house.
      - 'But he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his
        own soul:'
      - 'He gathereth to himself shame and dishonour, and his reproach shall not be
        blotted out:'
      - Because the jealousy and rage of the husband will not spare in the day of
        revenge,
      - Nor will he yield to any manâ€™s prayers, nor will he accept for satisfaction
        ever so many gifts.
