          - note: Some understand this of Sennacherib. But as his attempt against
              the people seems to have been prior to the prophecy of Nahum, we may
              better understand it of Holofernes.

    verse:
      - ~
      - The burden of Ninive. The book of the vision of Nahum, the Elcesite.
      - 'The Lord is a jealous God, and a revenger: the Lord is a revenger, and hath
        wrath: the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he is angry with
        his enemies.'
      - The Lord is patient, and great in power, and will not cleanse and acquit the
        guilty. The Lordâ€™s ways are in a tempest, and a whirlwind, and clouds are
        the dust of his feet.
      - 'He rebuketh the sea and drieth it up: and bringeth all the rivers to be a
        desert. Basan languisheth and Carmel: and the flower of Libanus fadeth away.'
      - 'The mountains tremble at him, and the hills are made desolate: and the earth
        hath quaked at his presence, and the world, and all that dwell therein.'
      - 'Who can stand before the face of his indignation? and who shall resist in
        the fierceness of his anger? his indignation is poured out like fire: and
        the rocks are melted by him.'
      - 'The Lord is good, and giveth strength in the day of trouble: and knoweth
        them that hope in him.'
      - 'But with a flood that passeth by, he will make an utter end of the place
        thereof: and darkness shall pursue his enemies.'
      - 'What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make an utter end: there shall
        not rise a double affliction.'
      - 'For as thorns embrace one another: so while they are feasting and drinking
        together, they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry.'
      - Out of thee shall come forth one that imagineth evil against the Lord, contriving
        treachery in his mind.
      - 'Thus saith the Lord: Though they were perfect: and many of them so, yet thus
        shall they be cut off, and he shall pass: I have afflicted thee, and I will
        afflict thee no more.'
      - And now I will break in pieces his rod with which he struck thy back, and
        I will burst thy bonds asunder.
      - 'And the Lord will give a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy
        name shall be sown: I will destroy the graven and molten thing out of the
        house of thy God, I will make it thy grave, for thou art disgraced.'
      - 'Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, and
        that preacheth peace: O Juda, keep thy festivals, and pay thy vows: for Belial
        shall no more pass through thee again, he is utterly cut off.'

    footnotes:
      '2':
        instances:
          - note: He hath punished Jacob for his pride; and therefore Ninive must
              not expect to escape. Or else, rendering the pride of Jacob means rewarding,
              that is, punishing Ninive for the pride they exercised against Jacob.

      '5':
        instances:
          - note: By running hastily on.
            quote: Stumble in their march
    verse:
      - ~
      - 'He is come up that shall destroy before thy face, that shall keep the siege:
        watch the way, fortify thy loins, strengthen thy power exceedingly.'
      - 'For the Lord hath rendered the pride of Jacob, as the pride of Israel: because
        the spoilers have laid them waste, and have marred their vine branches.'
      - The shield of his mighty men is like fire, the men of the army are clad in
        scarlet, the reins of the chariot are flaming in the day of his preparation,
        and the drivers are stupefied.
      - 'They are in confusion in the ways, the chariots jostle one against another
        in the streets: their looks are like torches, like lightning running to and
        fro.'
      - 'He will muster up his valiant men, they shall stumble in their march: they
        shall quickly get upon the walls thereof: and a covering shall be prepared.'
      - The gates of the rivers are opened, and the temple is thrown down to the ground.
      - 'And the soldier is led away captive: and her bondwomen were led away mourning
        as doves, murmuring in their hearts.'
      - 'And as for Ninive, her waters are like a great pool: but the men flee away.
        They cry: Stand, stand, but there is none that will return back.'
      - 'Take ye the spoil of the silver, take the spoil of the gold: for there is
        no end of the riches of all the precious furniture.'
      - 'She is destroyed, and rent, and torn: the heart melteth, and the knees fail,
        and all the loins lose their strength: and the faces of them all are as the
        blackness of a kettle.'
      - Where is now the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young
        lions, to which the lion went, to enter in thither, the young lion, and there
        was none to make them afraid?
      - 'The lion caught enough for his whelps, and killed for his lionesses: and
        he filled his holes with prey, and his den with rapine.'
      - 'Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will burn thy
        chariots even to smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I
        will cut off thy prey out of the land, and the voice of thy messengers shall
        be heard no more.'

      '8':
        instances:
          - note: No-Ammon. A populous city of Egypt destroyed by the Chaldeans, and
              afterwards rebuilt by Alexander, and called Alexandria. Others suppose
              No-Ammon to be the same as Diospolis.
            quote: Populous Alexandria
    verse:
      - ~
      - 'Woe to thee, O city of blood, all full of lies and violence: rapine shall
        not depart from thee.'
      - The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of
        the neighing horse; and of the running chariot, and of the horsemen coming
        up,
      - 'And of the shining sword, and of the glittering spear, and of a multitude
        slain, and of a grievous destruction: and there is no end of carcasses, and
        they shall fall down on their dead bodies.'
      - Because of the multitude of the fornications of the harlot that was beautiful
        and agreeable, and that made use of witchcraft, that sold nations through
        her fornications, and families through her witchcrafts.
      - 'Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will discover
        thy shame to thy face, and will shew thy nakedness to the nations, and thy
        shame to kingdoms.'
      - And I will cast abominations upon thee, and will disgrace thee, and will make
        an example of thee.
      - 'And it shall come to pass that every one that shall see thee, shall flee
        from thee, and shall say: Ninive is laid waste: who shall bemoan thee? whence
        shall I seek a comforter for thee?'
      - 'Art thou better than the populous Alexandria, that dwelleth among the rivers?
        waters are round about it: the sea is its riches: the waters are its walls.'
      - 'Ethiopia and Egypt were the strength thereof, and there is no end: Africa
        and the Libyans were thy helpers.'
      - 'Yet she also was removed and carried into captivity: her young children were
        dashed in pieces at the top of every street, and they cast lots upon her nobles,
        and all her great men were bound in fetters.'
      - 'Therefore thou also shalt be made drunk, and shalt be despised: and thou
        shalt seek help from the enemies.'
      - 'All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with their green figs: if they
        be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of the eater.'
      - 'Behold thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy land shall
        be set wide open to thy enemies, the fire shall devour thy bars.'
      - 'Draw thee water for the siege, build up thy bulwarks: go into the clay, and
        tread, work it and make brick.'
      - 'There shall the fire devour thee: thou shalt perish by the sword, it shall
        devour thee like the bruchus: assemble together like the bruchus, make thyself
        many like the locust.'
      - 'Thou hast multiplied thy merchandises above the stars of heaven: the bruchus
        hath spread himself and flown away.'
      - 'Thy guards are like the locusts: and thy little ones like the locusts of
        locusts which swarm on the hedges in the day of cold: the sun arose, and they
        flew away, and their place was not known where they were.'
      - 'Thy shepherds have slumbered, O king of Assyria, thy princes shall be buried:
        thy people are hid in the mountains, and there is none to gather them.'
      - 'Thy destruction is not hidden, thy wound is grievous: all that have heard
        the fame of thee, have clapped their hands over thee: for upon whom hath not
        thy wickedness passed continually?'
