book_intro: Colossa was a city of Phrygia, near Laodicea. It does not appear that
  St. Paul had preached there himself, but that the Colossians were converted by Epaphras,
  a disciple of the Apostles. However, as St. Paul was the great Apostle of the Gentiles,
  he wrote this Epistle to the Colossians when he was in prison, and about the same
  time that he wrote to the Ephesians and Philippians. The exhortations and doctrine
  it contains are similar to that which is set forth in his Epistle to the Ephesians.

      - 'Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy, a brother:'
      - To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ Jesus who are at Colossa.
      - Grace be to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
        We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always
        for you.
      - Hearing your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have towards all
        the saints.
      - For the hope that is laid up for you in heaven, which you have heard in the
        word of the truth of the gospel,
      - Which is come unto you, as also it is in the whole world and bringeth forth
        fruit and groweth, even as it doth in you, since the day you heard and knew
        the grace of God in truth.
      - As you learned of Epaphras, our most beloved fellow servant, who is for you
        a faithful minister of Christ Jesus;
      - Who also hath manifested to us your love in the spirit.
      - 'Therefore we also, from the day that we heard it, cease not to pray for you
        and to beg that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom
        and spiritual understanding:'
      - 'That you may walk worthy of God, in all things pleasing; being fruitful in
        every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God:'
      - Strengthened with all might according to the power of his glory, in all patience
        and longsuffering with joy,
      - 'Giving thanks to God the Father, who hath made us worthy to be partakers
        of the lot of the saints in light:'
      - Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into
        the kingdom of the Son of his love,
      - 'In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins:'
      - 'Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:'
      - For in him were all things created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
        whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or powers. All things
        were created by him and in him.
      - 'And he is before all: and by him all things consist.'
      - 'And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn
        from the dead, that in all things he may hold the primacy:'
      - 'Because in him, it hath well pleased the Father that all fulness should dwell:'
      - And through him to reconcile all things unto himself, making peace through
        the blood of his cross, both as to the things that are on earth and the things
        that are in heaven.
      - 'And you, whereas you were some time alienated and enemies in mind in evil
        works:'
      - 'Yet now he hath reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present
        you holy and unspotted and blameless before him:'
      - 'If so ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and immoveable from
        the hope of the gospel which you have heard, which is preached in all the
        creation that is under heaven: whereof I Paul am made a minister.'
      - 'Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things that are
        wanting of the sufferings of Christ, in my flesh, for his body, which is the
        church:'
      - 'Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which
        is given me towards you, that I may fulfil the word of God:'
      - The mystery which hath been hidden from ages and generations, but now is manifested
        to his saints,
      - To whom God would make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among
        the Gentiles, which is Christ, in you the hope of glory.
      - Whom we preach, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom,
        that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
      - Wherein also I labour, striving according to his working which he worketh
        in me in power.

              falsely pretending humility, but really proceeding from pride. Such
              was the worship, that many of the philosophers (against whom St. Paul
              speaks, ver. 8) paid to angels or demons, by sacrificing to them, as
              carriers of intelligence betwixt God and men; pretending humility in
              so doing, as if God was too great to be addressed by men; and setting
              aside the mediatorship of Jesus Christ, who is the head both of angels
              and men. Such also was the worship paid by the ancient heretics, disciples
              of Simon and Menander, to the angels, whom they believed to be makers
              and lords of this lower world. This is certain, that they whom the apostle
              here condemns, did not hold the head, (ver. 19,) that is, Jesus Christ,
              and his mediatorship; and therefore what he writes here no way touches
              the Catholic doctrine and practice, of desiring our good angels to pray
              to God for us, through Jesus Christ. St. Jerome [Epist. ad Algas.] understands
              by the religion or service of angels, the Jewish teachers, who sought
              to subject the new Christians to the observance of the Mosaic law.

        beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith which is in Christ.
      - 'As therefore you have received Jesus Christ the Lord, walk ye in him:'
      - 'Rooted and built up in him and confirmed in the faith, as also you have learned:
        abounding in him in thanksgiving.'
      - 'Beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy and vain deceit: according to
        the tradition of men according to the elements of the world and not according
        to Christ.'
      - For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally.

        he hath quickened together with him, forgiving you all offences:'
      - Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which was
        contrary to us. And he hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to
        the cross.

        in the things which he hath not seen, in vain puffed up by the sense of his
        flesh:'
      - And not holding the head, from which the whole body, by joints and bands,
        being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth into the increase of
        God.
      - If then you be dead with Christ from the elements of this world, why do you
        yet decree as though living in the world?
      - 'Touch not: taste not: handle not.'
      - Which all are unto destruction by the very use, according to the precepts
        and doctrines of men.
      - Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and humility, and
        not sparing the body; not in any honour to the filling of the flesh.

      - Therefore if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where
        Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.
      - Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.
      - 'For you are dead: and your life is hid with Christ in God.'
      - When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with
        him in glory.
      - 'Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness,
        lust, evil concupiscence and covetousness, which is the service of idols.'
      - For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief.
      - In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.

        speech out of your mouth.'
      - 'Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds,'
      - And putting on the new, him who is renewed unto knowledge, according to the
        image of him that created him.
      - Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian
        nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all and in all.
      - 'Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, the bowels of
        mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:'
      - Bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint
        against another. Even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also.
      - But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection.
      - 'And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are
        called in one body: and be ye thankful.'
      - 'Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly: in all wisdom, teaching and
        admonishing one another in psalms, hymns and spiritual canticles, singing
        in grace in your hearts to God.'
      - All whatsoever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus
        Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

          - note: What this epistle was is uncertain, and annotators have given different
              opinions concerning it. Some expound these words of an epistle which
              St. Paul wrote to the Laodiceans, and is since lost, for that now extant
              is no more than a collection of sentences out of the other epistles
              of St. Paul; therefore it cannot be considered even as a part of that
              epistle. Others explain that the text means a letter sent to St. Paul
              by the Laodiceans, which he sends to the Colossians to be read by them.
              However, this opinion does not seem well founded. Hence it is more probable
              that St. Paul wrote an epistle from Rome to the Laodiceans, about the
              same time that he wrote to the Colossians, as he had them both equally
              at heart, and that he ordered that epistle to be read by the Colossians
              for their instructions; and being neighbouring cities, they might communicate
              to each other what they had received from him; as one epistle might
              contain some matters not related in the other, and would be equally
              useful for their concern; and more particularly as they were equally
              disturbed by intruders and false teachers, against which the apostle
              was anxious to warn them, lest they should be infected by their pernicious
              doctrine.
