book_intro: 'JONAS prophesied in the reign of JEREBOAM the second: as we learn from
  4 Kings 14.25. To whom also he foretold his success in restoring all the borders
  of Israel. He was of GETH OPHER in the tribe of ZABULON, and consequently of GALILEE:
  which confutes that assertion of the Pharisees, John 7.52, that no prophet ever
  rose out of GALILEE. He prophesied and prefigured in his own person the death and
  resurrection of CHRIST: and was the only one among the prophets that was sent to
  preach to the Gentiles.'

        the Lord,'

      - 'And the mariners were afraid, and the men cried to their god: and they cast
        forth the wares that were in the ship, into the sea, to lighten it of them:

        sleep.'
      - 'And the ship master came to him and said to him: Why art thou fast asleep?
        rise up call upon thy God, if so be that God will think of us that we may
        not perish.'
      - 'And they said every one to his fellow: Come and let us cast lots, that we
        may know why this evil is upon us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon
        Jonas.'
      - 'And they said to him: Tell us for what cause this evil is upon us, what is
        thy business? of what country art thou? and whither goest thou? or of what
        people art thou?'
      - 'And he said to them: I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven,
        who made both the sea and the dry land.'
      - 'And the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him: Why hast thou done
        this? (For the men knew that he fled from the face of the Lord: because he
        had told them.)'
      - 'And they said to him: What shall we do with thee, that the sea may be calm
        to us? for the sea flowed and swelled.'
      - 'And he said to them: take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall
        be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.'
      - 'And the men rowed hard to return to land, but they were not able: because
        the sea tossed and swelled upon them.'
      - 'And they cried to the Lord, and said: We beseech thee, O Lord let us not
        perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou,
        O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.'
      - And they took Jonas, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased from raging.
      - And the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and sacrificed victims to the Lord,
        and made vows.

      - 'And thou hast cast me forth into the deep, in the heart of the sea, and a
        flood hath compassed me: all thy billows, and thy waves have passed over me.'

        see thy holy temple again.'

        of the king and of his princes, saying: Let neither men nor beasts, oxen,
        nor sheep taste anything: let them not feed, nor drink water.'
      - And let men and beasts be covered with sackcloth, and cry to the Lord with
        all their strength, and let them turn every one from his evil way, and from
        the iniquity that is in their hands.

      - 'And he prayed to the Lord, and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, is not this
        what I said, when I was yet in my own country? therefore I went before to
        flee into Tharsis: for I know that thou art a gracious and merciful God, patient,
        and of much compassion, and easy to forgive evil.'

        me to die than to live.'
      - 'And the Lord said: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry?'

        and he made himself a booth there, and he sat under it in the shadow, till
        he might see what would befall the city.'
      - 'And the Lord God prepared an ivy, and it came up over the head of Jonas,
        to be a shadow over his head, and to cover him (for he was fatigued): and
        Jonas was exceeding glad of the ivy.'

        it struck the ivy and it withered.'
      - 'And when the sun was risen, the Lord commanded a hot and burning wind: and
        the sun beat upon the head of Jonas, and he broiled with the heat: and he
        desired for his soul that he might die, and said: It is better for me to die
        than to live.'
      - 'And the Lord said to Jonas: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry,
        for the ivy? And he said: I am angry with reason even unto death.'
      - 'And the Lord said: Thou art grieved for the ivy, for which thou hast not
        laboured, nor made it to grow, which in one night came up, and in one night
        perished.'
      - And shall I not spare Ninive, that great city, in which there are more than
        a hundred and twenty thousand persons, that know not how to distinguish between
        their right hand and their left, and many beasts?
