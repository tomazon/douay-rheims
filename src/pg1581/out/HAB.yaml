    verse:
      - ~
      - The burden that Habacuc the prophet saw.
      - How long, O Lord, shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? shall I cry out to
        thee suffering violence, and thou wilt not save?
      - Why hast thou shewn me iniquity and grievance, to see rapine and injustice
        before me? and there is a judgment, but opposition is more powerful.
      - 'Therefore the law is torn in pieces, and judgment cometh not to the end:
        because the wicked prevaileth against the just, therefore wrong judgment goeth
        forth.'
      - 'Behold ye among the nations, and see: wonder, and be astonished: for a work
        is done in your days, which no man will believe when it shall be told.'
      - For behold, I will raise up the Chaldeans, a bitter and swift nation, marching
        upon the breadth of the earth, to possess the dwelling places that are not
        their own.
      - 'They are dreadful, and terrible: from themselves shall their judgment, and
        their burden proceed.'
      - 'Their horses are lighter than leopards, and swifter than evening wolves;
        and their horsemen shall be spread abroad: for their horsemen shall come from
        afar, they shall fly as an eagle that maketh haste to eat.'
      - 'They shall all come to the prey, their face is like a burning wind: and they
        shall gather together captives as the sand.'
      - 'And their prince shall triumph over kings, and princes shall be his laughingstock:
        and he shall laugh at every strong hold, and shall cast up a mount, and shall
        take it.'
      - 'Then shall his spirit be changed, and he shall pass, and fall: this is his
        strength of his god.'
      - 'Wast thou not from the beginning, O Lord my God, my holy one, and we shall
        not die? Lord, thou hast appointed him for judgment: and made him strong for
        correction.'
      - Thy eyes are too pure to behold evil, and thou canst not look on iniquity.
        Why lookest thou upon them that do unjust things, and holdest thy peace when
        the wicked devoureth the man that is more just than himself?
      - And thou wilt make men as the fishes of the sea, and as the creeping things
        that have no ruler.
      - 'He lifted up all them with his hook, he drew them in his drag, and gathered
        them into his net: for this he will be glad and rejoice.'
      - 'Therefore will he offer victims to his drag, and he will sacrifice to his
        net: because through them his portion is made fat, and his meat dainty.'
      - For this cause therefore he spreadeth his net, and will not spare continually
        to slay the nations.
  - chapter_intro: The prophet is admonished to wait with faith. The enemies of God’s
      people shall assuredly be punished.

              that the Chaldeans, who are worse than the Jews, and who attribute all
              their success to their own strength, or to their idols, should nevertheless
              prevail over the people of the Lord. The Lord’s answer is, that the
              prophet must wait with patience and faith: that all should be set right
              in due time; and the enemies of God and his people punished according
              to their deserts.'

        me.'
      - 'And the Lord answered me, and said: Write the vision, and make it plain upon
        tables: that he that readeth it may run over it.'
      - 'For as yet the vision is far off, and it shall appear at the end, and shall
        not lie: if it make any delay, wait for it: for it shall surely come, and
        it shall not be slack.'
      - 'Behold, he that is unbelieving, his soul shall not be right in himself: but
        the just shall live in his faith.'
      - 'And as wine deceiveth him that drinketh it: so shall the proud man be, and
        he shall not be honoured: who hath enlarged his desire like hell: and is himself
        like death, and he is never satisfied: but will gather together unto him all
        nations, and heap together unto him all people.'
      - 'Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a dark speech concerning
        him: and it shall be said: Woe to him that heapeth together that which is
        not his own? how long also doth he load himself with thick clay?'
      - 'Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee: and they be stirred
        up that shall tear thee, and thou shalt be a spoil to them?'
      - 'Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all that shall be left of the people
        shall spoil thee: because of men’s blood, and for the iniquity of the land,
        of the city, and of all that dwell therein.'
      - Woe to him that gathereth together an evil covetousness to his house, that
        his nest may be on high, and thinketh he may be delivered out of the hand
        of evil.
      - Thou hast devised confusion to thy house, thou hast cut off many people, and
        thy soul hath sinned.
      - 'For the stone shall cry out of the wall: and the timber that is between the
        joints of the building, shall answer.'
      - Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and prepareth a city by iniquity.
      - 'Are not these things from the Lord of hosts? for the people shall labour
        in a great fire: and the nations in vain, and they shall faint.'
      - For the earth shall be filled, that men may know the glory of the Lord, as
        waters covering the sea.
      - Woe to him that giveth drink to his friend, and presenteth his gall, and maketh
        him drunk, that he may behold his nakedness.
      - 'Thou art filled with shame instead of glory: drink thou also, and fall fast
        asleep: the cup of the right hand of the Lord shall compass thee, and shameful
        vomiting shall be on thy glory.'
      - For the iniquity of Libanus shall cover thee, and the ravaging of beasts shall
        terrify them because of the blood of men, and the iniquity of the land, and
        of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
      - What doth the graven thing avail, because the maker thereof hath graven it,
        a molten, and a false image? because the forger thereof hath trusted in a
        thing of his own forging, to make dumb idols.
      - 'Woe to him that saith to wood: Awake: to the dumb stone: Arise: can it teach?
        Behold, it is laid over with gold, and silver, and there is no spirit in the
        bowels thereof.'

      - A PRAYER OF HABACUC THE PROPHET FOR IGNORANCES.
      - 'O Lord, I have heard thy hearing, and was afraid. O Lord, thy work, in the
        midst of the years bring it to life: In the midst of the years thou shalt
        make it known: when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy.'
      - 'God will come from the south, and the holy one from mount Pharan: His glory
        covered the heavens, and the earth is full of his praise.'
      - 'His brightness shall be as the light: horns are in his hands: There is his
        strength hid:'
      - Death shall go before his face. And the devil shall go forth before his feet.
      - 'He stood and measured the earth. He beheld, and melted the nations: and the
        ancient mountains were crushed to pieces. The hills of the world were bowed
        down by the journeys of his eternity.'
      - I saw the tents of Ethiopia for their iniquity, the curtains of the land of
        Madian shall be troubled.
      - 'Wast thou angry, O Lord, with the rivers? or was thy wrath upon the rivers?
        or thy indignation in the sea? Who will ride upon thy horses: and thy chariots
        are salvation.'
      - 'Thou wilt surely take up thy bow: according to the oaths which thou hast
        spoken to the tribes. Thou wilt divide the rivers of the earth.'
      - 'The mountains saw thee, and were grieved: the great body of waters passed
        away. The deep put forth its voice: the deep lifted up its hands.'
      - The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation, in the light of thy
        arrows, they shall go in the brightness of thy glittering spear.
      - 'In thy anger thou wilt tread the earth under foot: in thy wrath thou wilt
        astonish the nations.'
      - 'Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people: for salvation with thy
        Christ. Thou struckest the head of the house of the wicked: thou hast laid
        bare his foundation even to the neck.'
      - Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors, them that came out
        as a whirlwind to scatter me. Their joy was like that of him that devoureth
        the poor man in secret.
      - Thou madest a way in the sea for thy horses, in the mud of many waters.
      - 'I have heard and my bowels were troubled: my lips trembled at the voice.
        Let rottenness enter into my bones, and swarm under me. That I may rest in
        the day of tribulation: that I may go up to our people that are girded.'
      - 'For the fig tree shall not blossom: and there shall be no spring in the vines.
        The labour of the olive tree shall fail: and the fields shall yield no food:
        the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the
        stalls.'
      - 'But I will rejoice in the Lord: and I will joy in God my Jesus.'
      - 'The Lord God is my strength: and he will make my feet like the feet of harts:
        and he the conqueror will lead me upon my high places singing psalms.'
