book_intro: 'St. Jude, who wrote this Epistle, was one of the twelve Apostles and
  brother to St. James the Less. The time it was written is uncertain: only it may
  be inferred from verse 17 that few or none of the Apostles were then living, except
  St. John. He inveighs against the heresies and wicked practices of the Simonians,
  Nicolaites, and Gnostics, etc., describing them and their leaders by strong epithets
  and similes, He exhorts the faithful to contend earnestly for the faith first delivered
  to them and to beware of heretics.'

    footnotes:
      '11':
        instances:
          - note: Heretics follow the way of Cain, by murdering the souls of their
              brethren; the way of Balaam, by putting a scandal before the people
              of God, for their own private ends; and the way of Core or Korah, by
              their opposition to the church governors of divine appointment.
            quote: Gone in the way

      '14':
        instances:
          - note: This prophecy was either known by tradition, or from some book that
              is since lost.
            quote: Prophesied
      '17':
        instances:
          - note: He now exhorts the faithful to remain steadfast in the belief and
              practice of what they had heard from the apostles, who had also foretold
              that in aftertimes (lit. in the last time) there should be false teachers,
              scoffing and ridiculing all revealed truths, abandoning themselves to
              their passions and lusts; who separate themselves from the Catholic
              communion by heresies and schisms.
            quote: But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful
            quote_ends_in_etc: 'true'
          - note: carried away and enslaved by the pleasures of the senses.
            quote: Sensual men
      '21':
        instances:
          - note: Raising by your actions, a spiritual building, founded, 1st, upon
              faith; 2d, on the love of God; 3d, upon hope, whilst you are waiting
              for the mercies of God, and the reward of eternal life; 4th, joined
              with the great duty of prayer.
            quote: Building yourselves upon your most holy faith
      '23':
        instances:
          - note: 'He gives them another instruction to practice charity in endeavouring
              to convert their neighbour, where they will meet with three sorts of
              persons: 1st, With persons obstinate in their errors and sins; these
              may be said to be already judged and condemned; they are to be sharply
              reprehended, reproved, and if possible convinced of their error. 2d,
              As to others you must endeavour to save them, by pulling them, as it
              were, out of the fire, from the ruin they stand in great danger of.
              3d, You must have mercy on others in fear, when you see them through
              ignorance of frailty, in danger of being drawn into the snares of these
              heretics; with these you must deal more gently and mildly, with a charitable
              compassion, hating always, and teaching others to hate the carnal garment
              which is spotted, their sensual and corrupt manners, that defile both
              the soul and body.'
            quote: And some indeed reprove being judged
      '25':
        instances:
          - note: St. Jude concludes his epistle with this doxology of praising God,
              and praying to the only God our Saviour, which may either signify God
              the Father, or God as equally agreeing to all the three persons, who
              are equally the cause of Christ’s incarnation, and man’s salvation,
              through Jesus Christ our Lord, who, being God from eternity, took upon
              him our human nature, that he might become our Redeemer.
            quote: Now to him

      '6':
        instances:
          - note: That is, the state in which they were first created, their original
              dignity.
            quote: Principality
      '8':
        instances:
          - note: Speak evil of them that are in dignity; and even utter blasphemies
              against the divine majesty.
            quote: Blaspheme majesty
      '9':
        instances:
          - note: This contention, which is no where else mentioned in holy writ,
              was originally known by revelation, and transmitted by tradition. It
              is thought the occasion of it was, that the devil would have had the
              body buried in such a place and manner, as to be worshipped by the Jews
              with divine honours.
            quote: Contended about the body

    verse:
      - ~
      - 'Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James: to them that are
        beloved in God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called.'
      - 'Mercy unto you and peace: and charity be fulfilled.'
      - 'Dearly beloved, taking all care to write unto you concerning your common
        salvation, I was under a necessity to write unto you: to beseech you to contend
        earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.'
      - For certain men are secretly entered in (who were written of long ago unto
        this judgment), ungodly men, turning the grace of our Lord God into riotousness
        and denying the only sovereign Ruler and our Lord Jesus Christ.
      - I will therefore admonish you, though ye once knew all things, that Jesus,
        having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, did afterwards destroy them
        that believed not.
      - And the angels who kept not their principality but forsook their own habitation,
        he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains, unto the judgment of
        the great day.
      - As Sodom and Gomorrha and the neighbouring cities, in like manner, having
        given themselves to fornication and going after other flesh, were made an
        example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
      - In like manner, these men also defile the flesh and despise dominion and blaspheme
        majesty.
      - 'When Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil, contended about the
        body of Moses, he durst not bring against him the judgment of railing speech,
        but said: The Lord command thee.'
      - 'But these men blaspheme whatever things they know not: and what things soever
        they naturally know, like dumb beasts, in these they are corrupted.'
      - 'Woe unto them! For they have gone in the way of Cain: and after the error
        of Balaam they have for reward poured out themselves and have perished in
        the contradiction of Core.'
      - 'These are spots in their banquets, feasting together without fear, feeding
        themselves: clouds without water, which are carried about by winds: trees
        of the autumn, unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the roots:'
      - 'Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own confusion: wandering stars,
        to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever.'
      - 'Now of these Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying: Behold,
        the Lord cometh with thousands of his saints:'
      - 'To execute judgment upon all and to reprove all the ungodly for all the works
        of their ungodliness, whereby they have done ungodly: and for all the hard
        things which ungodly sinners have spoken against God.'
      - 'These are murmurers, full of complaints, walking according to their own desires:
        and their mouth speaketh proud things, admiring persons, for gain’s sake.'
      - 'But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful of the words which have been spoken
        before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:'
      - Who told you that in the last time there should come mockers, walking according
        to their own desires in ungodlinesses.
      - These are they who separate themselves, sensual men, having not the Spirit.
      - But you, my beloved, building yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying
        in the Holy Ghost,
      - Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
        Christ, unto life everlasting.
      - 'And some indeed reprove, being judged:'
      - But others save, pulling them out of the fire. And on others have mercy, in
        fear, hating also the spotted garment which is carnal.
      - 'Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to present you spotless
        before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, in the coming of our
        Lord Jesus Christ:'
      - To the only God our Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory and magnificence,
        empire and power, before all ages, and now, and for all ages of ages. Amen.
