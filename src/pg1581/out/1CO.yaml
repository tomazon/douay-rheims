book_intro: St. Paul, having planted the faithful in Corinth, where he had preached
  a year and a half and converted a great many, went to Ephesus. After being there
  three years, he wrote this first Epistle to the Corinthians and sent it by the same
  persons, Stephanus, Fortunatus and Achaicus, who had brought their letter to him.
  It was written about twenty-four years after our Lord’s Ascension and contains several
  matters appertaining to faith and morals and also to ecclesiastical discipline.

      - Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes
        a brother,
      - To the church of God that is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ
        Jesus, called to be saints, with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus
        Christ in every place of theirs and ours.
      - Grace to you and peace, from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
      - 'I give thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is given
        you in Christ Jesus:'
      - That in all things you are made rich in him, in all utterance and in all knowledge;
      - As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,
      - So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the manifestation
        of our Lord Jesus Christ.
      - Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the day of the coming
        of our Lord Jesus Christ.
      - 'God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son, Jesus
        Christ our Lord.'
      - 'Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you
        all speak the same thing and that there be no schisms among you: but that
        you be perfect in the same mind and in the same judgment.'
      - For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are
        of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
      - 'Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am
        of Apollo; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.'
      - Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? Or were you baptized in
        the name of Paul?
      - 'I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius:'
      - Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.
      - And I baptized also the household of Stephanus. Besides, I know not whether
        I baptized any other.
      - 'For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom
        of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.'
      - 'For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness: but
        to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.'
      - 'For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise: and the prudence
        of the prudent I will reject.'
      - Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world?
        Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
      - For, seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world, by wisdom, knew not God,
        it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.
      - 'For both the Jews require signs: and the Greeks seek after wisdom.'
      - 'But we preach Christ crucified: unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and
        unto the Gentiles foolishness:'
      - But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of
        God and the wisdom of God.
      - 'For the foolishness of God is wiser than men: and the weakness of God is
        stronger than men.'
      - For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to
        the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble.
      - 'But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound
        the wise: and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound
        the strong.'
      - 'And the base things of the world and the things that are contemptible, hath
        God chosen: and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things
        that are:'
      - That no flesh should glory in his sight.
      - 'But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and
        justice and sanctification and redemption:'
      - 'That, as it is written: He that glorieth may glory in the Lord.'
  - chapter_intro: His preaching was not in loftiness of words, but in spirit and
      power. And the wisdom he taught was not to be understood by the worldly wise
      or sensual man, but only by the spiritual man.

              little or no notion of the things of God. Whereas the spiritual man
              is he who, in the mysteries of religion, takes not human sense for his
              guide: but submits his judgment to the decisions of the church, which
              he is commanded to hear and obey. For Christ hath promised to remain
              to the end of the world with his church, and to direct her in all things

      - And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of
        wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.
      - 'For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ: and
        him crucified.'
      - And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
      - 'And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom,
        but in shewing of the Spirit and power:'
      - That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of
        God.
      - 'Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world,
        neither of the princes of this world that come to nought.'
      - 'But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which
        God ordained before the world, unto our glory:'
      - Which none of the princes of this world knew. For if they had known it, they
        would never have crucified the Lord of glory.
      - 'But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard: neither hath
        it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that
        love him.'
      - But to us God hath revealed them by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all
        things, yea, the deep things of God.
      - For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is
        in him? So the things also that are of God, no man knoweth, but the Spirit
        of God.
      - 'Now, we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is
        of God: that we may know the things that are given us from God.'
      - 'Which things also we speak: not in the learned words of human wisdom, but
        in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.'
      - 'But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of
        God. For it is foolishness to him: and he cannot understand, because it is
        spiritually examined.'
      - 'But the spiritual man judgeth all things: and he himself is judged of no
        man.'
      - For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we
        have the mind of Christ.

              silver, and precious stones, signifies the more perfect preaching and
              practice of the gospel; the wood, hay, and stubble, such preaching as
              that of the Corinthian teachers (who affected the pomp of words and
              human eloquence) and such practice as is mixed with much imperfection,
              and many lesser sins. Now the day of the Lord, and his fiery trial,
              (in the particular judgment immediately after death,) shall make manifest
              of what sort every man’s work has been: of which, during this life,
              it is hard to make a judgment. For then the fire of God’s judgment shall
              try every man’s work. And they, whose works, like wood, hay, and stubble,
              cannot abide the fire, shall suffer loss; these works being found to
              be of no value; yet they themselves, having built upon the right foundation,
              (by living and dying in the true faith and in the state of grace, though
              with some imperfection,) shall be saved yet so as by fire; being liable

      - And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.
        As unto little ones in Christ.
      - 'I gave you milk to drink, not meat: for you were not able as yet. But neither
        indeed are you now able: for you are yet carnal.'
      - For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal
        and walk you not according to man?
      - 'For while one saith: I indeed am of Paul: and another: I am of Apollo: are
        you not men? What then is Apollo and what is Paul?'
      - 'The ministers of him whom you have believed: and to every one as the Lord
        hath given.'

      - 'Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth: but
        God that giveth the increase.'
      - Now he that planteth and he that watereth, are one. And every man shall receive
        his own reward, according to his own labour.
      - 'For we are God’s coadjutors. You are God’s husbandry: you are God’s building.'
      - 'According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I
        have laid the foundation: and another buildeth thereon. But let every man
        take heed how he buildeth thereupon.'
      - 'For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid: which is Christ
        Jesus.'
      - 'Now, if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones,
        wood, hay, stubble:'
      - Every man’s work shall be manifest. For the day of the Lord shall declare
        it, because it shall be revealed in fire. And the fire shall try every man’s
        work, of what sort it is.
      - If any man’s work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a
        reward.
      - 'If any man’s work burn, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved,
        yet so as by fire.'
      - Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth
        in you?
      - But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple
        of God is holy, which you are.
      - Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seem to be wise in this world,
        let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
      - 'For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written:
        I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.'
      - 'And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.'
      - Let no man therefore glory in men.

        or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. For all are yours.

    verses:
      - ~
      - Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the dispensers
        of the mysteries of God.
      - Here now it is required among the dispensers that a man be found faithful.
      - But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by man’s day. But
        neither do I judge my own self.
      - 'For I am not conscious to myself of anything. Yet am I not hereby justified:
        but he that judgeth me is the Lord.'
      - 'Therefore, judge not before the time: until the Lord come, who both will
        bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels
        of the hearts. And then shall every man have praise from God.'
      - 'But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and
        to Apollo, for your sakes: that in us you may learn that one be not puffed
        up against the other for another, above that which is written.'
      - For who distinguisheth thee? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received,
        and if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received
        it?
      - 'You are now full: you are now become rich: you reign without us; and I would
        to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.'
      - For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men
        appointed to death. We are made a spectacle to the world and to angels and
        to men.
      - 'We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ: we are weak,
        but you are strong: you are honourable, but we without honour.'
      - Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted
        and have no fixed abode.
      - 'And we labour, working with our own hands. We are reviled: and we bless.
        We are persecuted: and we suffer it.'
      - 'We are blasphemed: and we entreat. We are made as the refuse of this world,
        the offscouring of all, even until now.'
      - 'I write not these things to confound you: but I admonish you as my dearest
        children.'
      - For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers.
        For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.
      - Wherefore, I beseech you, be ye followers of me as I also am of Christ.
      - 'For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful
        in the Lord. Who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus:
        as I teach every where in every church.'
      - As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.
      - 'But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will: and will know, not the
        speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.'
      - For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.
      - What will you? Shall I come to you with a rod? Or in charity and in the spirit
        of meekness?

      - 'It is absolutely heard that there is fornication among you and such fornication
        as the like is not among the heathens: that one should have his father’s wife.'
      - 'And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned: that he might be taken
        away from among you that hath done this thing.'
      - I indeed, absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged, as though
        I were present, him that hath so done,
      - 'In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together and my
        spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus:'
      - To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the
        spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
      - Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the
        whole lump?
      - Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened.
        For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.
      - 'Therefore, let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of
        malice and wickedness: but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.'
      - I wrote to you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators.
      - 'I mean not with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or the
        extortioners or the servers of idols: otherwise you must needs go out of this
        world.'
      - 'But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named
        a brother be a fornicator or covetous or a server of idols or a railer or
        a drunkard or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.'
      - For what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do not you judge them
        that are within?
      - For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among
        yourselves.

      - Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take
        the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid!
      - Or know you not that he who is joined to a harlot is made one body? For they

      - 'But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife: and let every
        woman have her own husband.'
      - 'Let the husband render the debt to his wife: and the wife also in like manner
        to the husband.'
      - 'The wife hath not power of her own body: but the husband. And in like manner
        the husband also hath not power of his own body: but the wife.'
      - 'Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you
        may give yourselves to prayer: and return together again, lest Satan tempt
        you for your incontinency.'
      - But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment.
      - 'For I would that all men were even as myself. But every one hath his proper
        gift from God: one after this manner, and another after that.'
      - 'But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they
        so continue, even as I.'
      - But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to
        marry than to be burnt.
      - But to them that are married, not I, but the Lord, commandeth that the wife
        depart not from her husband.
      - And if she depart, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband.
        And let not the husband put away his wife.
      - 'For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother hath a wife that believeth
        not and she consent to dwell with him: let him not put her away.'
      - 'And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not and he consent to dwell
        with her: let her not put away her husband.'
      - 'For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife: and the
        unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise your children
        should be unclean: but now they are holy.'
      - But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not
        under servitude in such cases. But God hath called us in peace.
      - For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how
        knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
      - 'But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called every one:
        so let him walk. And so in all churches I teach.'
      - Is any man called, being circumcised? Let him not procure uncircumcision.
        Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
      - 'Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance
        of the commandments of God.'
      - Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.
      - 'Wast thou called, being a bondman? Care not for it: but if thou mayest be
        made free, use it rather.'
      - For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the
        Lord. Likewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ.
      - 'You are bought with a price: be not made the bondslaves of men.'
      - Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.
      - 'Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give counsel,
        as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.'
      - 'I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity: that it is
        good for a man so to be.'
      - Art thou bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife?
        Seek not a wife.
      - 'But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marry, she
        hath not sinned: nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But
        I spare you.'
      - 'This therefore I say, brethren: The time is short. It remaineth, that they
        also who have wives be as if they had none:'
      - 'And they that weep, as though they wept not: and they that rejoice, as if
        they rejoiced not: and they that buy as if they possessed not:'
      - And they that use this world, as if they used it not. For the fashion of this
        world passeth away.
      - 'But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife
        is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord: how he may please God.'
      - 'But he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world: how
        he may please his wife. And he is divided.'
      - 'And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord:
        that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh
        on the things of the world: how she may please her husband.'
      - And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that
        which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without
        impediment.
      - 'But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to his virgin,
        for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will.
        He sinneth not if she marry.'
      - 'For he that hath determined, being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity,
        but having power of his own will: and hath judged this in his heart, to keep
        his virgin, doth well.'
      - 'Therefore both he that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well: and he that
        giveth her not doth better.'
      - 'A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband
        die, she is at liberty. Let her marry to whom she will: only in the Lord.'
      - But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel.
        And I think that I also have the spirit of God.

      - But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is

        shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which
        are sacrificed to idols?
      - And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath

      - Now when you sin thus against the brethren and wound their weak conscience,

      - What is my reward then? That preaching the gospel, I may deliver the gospel
        without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.

        of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.'
      - 'For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.'
      - 'For the man was not created for the woman: but the woman for the man.'
      - Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.
      - But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man,
        in the Lord.
      - 'For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all
        things of God.'
      - You yourselves judge. Doth it become a woman to pray unto God uncovered?
      - Doth not even nature itself teach you that a man indeed, if he nourish his
        hair, it is a shame unto him?
      - But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given
        to her for a covering.
      - But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the Church
        of God.
      - 'Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together, not for the
        better, but for the worse.'
      - For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are
        schisms among you. And in part I believe it.
      - 'For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved may be
        made manifest among you.'
      - When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the
        Lord’s supper.
      - For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry
        and another is drunk.
      - What, have you no houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church
        of God and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I
        praise you? In this I praise you not.
      - For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that
        the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread,
      - 'And giving thanks, broke and said: Take ye and eat: This is my body, which
        shall be delivered for you. This do for the commemoration of me.'
      - 'In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice
        is the new testament in my blood. This do ye, as often as you shall drink,
        for the commemoration of me.'
      - For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice, you shall
        shew the death of the Lord, until he come.
      - Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord
        unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.
      - 'But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread and drink of
        the chalice.'
      - For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to
        himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.
      - 'Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you: and many sleep.'
      - But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
      - But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned
        with this world.
      - Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
      - If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto
        judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.

    verses:
      - ~
      - Now concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
      - You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as
        you were led.
      - Wherefore, I give you to understand that no man, speaking by the Spirit of
        God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say The Lord Jesus, but by the
        Holy Ghost.
      - Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit.
      - And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord.
      - And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all
        in all.
      - And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.
      - 'To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another,
        the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:'
      - 'To another, faith in the same spirit: to another, the grace of healing in
        one Spirit:'
      - 'To another the working of miracles: to another, prophecy: to another, the
        discerning of spirits: to another, diverse kinds of tongues: to another, interpretation
        of speeches.'
      - But all these things, one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one
        according as he will.
      - 'For as the body is one and hath many members; and all the members of the
        body, whereas they are many, yet are one body: So also is Christ.'
      - 'For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles,
        whether bond or free: and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.'
      - For the body also is not one member, but many.
      - 'If the foot should say: Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body:
        Is it therefore not of the body?'
      - 'And if the ear should say: Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body:
        Is it therefore not of the body?'
      - If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were
        hearing, where would be the smelling?
      - But now God hath set the members, every one of them, in the body as it hath
        pleased him.
      - And if they all were one member, where would be the body?
      - But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.
      - 'And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help. Nor again the head
        to the feet: I have no need of you.'
      - Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body are
        more necessary.
      - 'And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about
        these we put more abundant honour: and those that are our uncomely parts have
        more abundant comeliness.'
      - 'But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together,
        giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour.'
      - 'That there might be no schism in the body: but the members might be mutually
        careful one for another.'
      - 'And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it: or if
        one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.'
      - Now you are the body of Christ and members of member.
      - 'And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets,
        thirdly doctors: after that miracles: then the graces of healings, helps,
        governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.'
      - Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?
      - Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with
        tongues? Do all interpret?
      - But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent
        way.
  - chapter_intro: Charity is to be preferred before all gifts.
    chapter_number: 13
    verses:
      - ~
      - If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I
        am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
      - And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and all knowledge,
        and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have
        not charity, I am nothing.
      - And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should
        deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
      - 'Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely,
        is not puffed up,'
      - 'Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh
        no evil:'
      - 'Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth:'
      - Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all
        things.
      - 'Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void or tongues
        shall cease or knowledge shall be destroyed.'
      - 'For we know in part: and we prophesy in part.'
      - But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done
        away.
      - When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought
        as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.
      - 'We see now through a glass in a dark manner: but then face to face. Now I
        know in part: but then I shall know even as I am known.'
      - 'And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest
        of these is charity.'

              etc., in which, meeting together, they discovered to one another their
              various miraculous gifts of the Spirit, common in those primitive times;
              amongst which the apostle prefers that of prophesying before that of
              speaking strange tongues, because it was more to the public edification.
              Where also not, that the Latin, used in our liturgy, is so far from

    verses:
      - ~
      - Follow after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you
        may prophesy.
      - 'For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for
        no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries.'
      - But he that prophesieth speaketh to men unto edification and exhortation and
        comfort.
      - 'He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth
        the church.'
      - 'And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For
        greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues: unless
        perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification.'
      - But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit
        you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy
        or in doctrine?
      - Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they
        give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
      - For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the
        battle?
      - So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it
        be known what is said? For you shall be speaking into the air.
      - 'There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world: and none
        is without voice.'
      - 'If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak
        a barbarian: and he that speaketh a barbarian to me.'
      - So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto
        the edifying of the church.
      - And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.
      - 'For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth: but my understanding is without
        fruit.'
      - What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding,
        I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.
      - Else, if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place
        of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing? Because he knoweth not what thou
        sayest.
      - 'For thou indeed givest thanks well: but the other is not edified.'
      - I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.
      - 'But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that
        I may instruct others also: than ten thousand words in a tongue.'
      - 'Brethren, do not become children in sense. But in malice be children: and
        in sense be perfect.'
      - 'In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to
        this people: and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.'
      - 'Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers: but
        prophecies, not to unbelievers but to believers.'
      - If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak
        with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not
        say that you are mad?
      - 'But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not or an unlearned
        person, he is convinced of all: he is judged of all.'
      - The secrets of his heart are made manifest. And so, falling down on his face,
        he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.
      - 'How is it then, brethren? When you come together, every one of you hath a
        psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation:
        let all things be done to edification.'
      - 'If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and
        in course: and let one interpret.'
      - But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church and speak
        to himself and to God.
      - 'And let the prophets speak, two or three: and let the rest judge.'
      - But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.
      - For you may all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted.
      - And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
      - 'For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all
        the churches of the saints.'
      - 'Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak
        but to be subject, as also the law saith.'
      - But if they would learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home. For
        it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.
      - Or did the word of God come out from you? Or came it only unto you?
      - If any seem to be a prophet or spiritual, let him know the things that I write
        to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.
      - But if any man know not, he shall not be known.
      - 'Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy: and forbid not to speak with
        tongues.'
      - But let all things be done decently and according to order.

      - Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which
        also you have received and wherein you stand.
      - By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached
        unto you, unless you have believed in vain.
      - 'For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that Christ
        died for our sins, according to the scriptures:'

      - And that he was seen by Cephas, and after that by the eleven.
      - 'Then was he seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of whom many
        remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.'
      - 'After that, he was seen by James: then by all the apostles.'
      - And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due time.
      - For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle,
        because I persecuted the church of God.
      - 'But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace in me hath not been
        void: but I have laboured more abundantly than all they. Yet not I, but the
        grace of God with me:'
      - 'For whether I or they, so we preach: and so you have believed.'
      - Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some
        among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
      - But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.
      - 'And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain: and your faith
        is also vain.'
      - 'Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony
        against God, that he hath raised up Christ, whom he hath not raised up, if
        the dead rise not again.'
      - For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.
      - 'And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain: for you are yet in
        your sins.'
      - Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
      - If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
      - 'But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep:'
      - 'For by a man came death: and by a man the resurrection of the dead.'
      - And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.

          - note: 'Anathema signifies here a thing accursed. Maran-atha, which, according
              to St. Jerome and St. Chrysostom, signify, ‘The Lord is come’ already,
              and therefore is to be taken as an admonition to those who doubted of
              the resurrection, and to put them in mind that Christ, the judge of
              the living and the dead, is come already. Others explain Maran-atha:
              ‘May our Lord come’, that is, to judge and punish those with exemplary
              judgments and punishments, that do not love the Lord Jesus Christ.'
