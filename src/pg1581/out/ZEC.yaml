        words.

      - 'And I said: What come these to do? and he spoke, saying: These are the horns
        which have scattered Juda every man apart, and none of them lifted up his
        head: and these are come to fray them, to cast down the horns of the nations,
        that have lifted up the horn upon the land of Juda to scatter it.'

        whom they have pierced: and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an
        only son, and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the
        death of the firstborn.'

        in that day.'
