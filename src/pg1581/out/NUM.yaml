        that the lamps look over against the north, towards the table of the loaves
        of proposition, over against that part shall they give light, towards which
        the candlestick looketh.'
      - And Aaron did so, and he put the lamps upon the candlestick, as the Lord had
        commanded Moses.
      - 'Now this was the work of the candlestick, it was of beaten gold, both the
        shaft in the middle, and all that came out of both sides of the branches:
        according to the pattern which the Lord had shewn to Moses, so he made the
        candlestick.'
      - 'And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:'
      - Take the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, and thou shalt
        purify them,
      - 'According to this rite: Let them be sprinkled with the water of purification,
        and let them shave all the hairs of their flesh. And when they shall have
        washed their garments, and are cleansed,'
      - 'They shall take an ox of the herd, and for the offering thereof fine flour
        tempered with oil: and thou shalt take another ox of the herd for a sin offering:'
      - 'And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the covenant, calling
        together all the multitude of the children of Israel:'
      - 'And when the Levites are before the Lord, the children of Israel shall put
        their hands upon them:'
      - And Aaron shall offer the Levites, as a gift in the sight of the Lord from
        the children of Israel, that they may serve in his ministry.
      - The Levites also shall put their hands upon the heads of the oxen, of which
        thou shalt sacrifice one for sin, and the other for a holocaust to the Lord,
        to pray for them.
      - And thou shalt set the Levites in the sight of Aaron and of his, and shalt
        consecrate them being offered to the Lord,
      - And shalt separate them from the midst of the children of Israel, to be mine.
      - 'And afterwards they shall enter into the tabernacle of the covenant, to serve
        me. And thus shalt thou purify and consecrate them for an oblation of the
        Lord: for as a gift they were given me by the children of Israel.'
      - I have taken them instead of the firstborn that open every womb in Israel,
      - 'For all the firstborn of the children of Israel, both of men and of beasts,
        are mine. From the day that I slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt, have
        I sanctified them to myself:'
      - 'And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel:'
      - And have delivered them for a gift to Aaron and his sons out of the midst
        of the people, to serve me for Israel in the tabernacle of the covenant, and
        to pray for them, lest there should be a plague among the people, if they
        should presume to approach unto my sanctuary.
      - 'And Moses and Aaron and all the multitude of the children of Israel did with
        the Levites all that the Lord had commanded Moses:'
      - And they were purified, and washed their garments. And Aaron lifted them up
        in the sight of the Lord, and prayed for them,
      - That being purified they might go into the tabernacle of the covenant to do
        their services before Aaron and his sons. As the Lord had commanded Moses
        touching the Levites, so was it done.
      - 'And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:'
      - 'This is the law of the Levites: From twenty-five years old and upwards, they
        shall go in to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant.'
      - 'And when they shall have accomplished the fiftieth year of their age, they
        shall cease to serve:'
      - And they shall be the ministers of their brethren in the tabernacle of the
        covenant, to keep the things that are committed to their care, but not to
        do the works. Thus shalt thou order the Levites touching their charge.

      - The fourteenth day of this month in the evening, according to all the ceremonies
        and justifications thereof.
      - And Moses commanded the children of Israel that they should make the phase.
      - 'And they made it in its proper time: the fourteenth day of the month at evening,
        in mount Sinai. The children of Israel did according to all things that the
        Lord had commanded Moses.'
      - But behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a man, who could
        not make the phase on that day, coming to Moses and Aaron,
      - 'Said to them: We are unclean by occasion of the soul of a man. Why are we
        kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to the Lord among
        the children of Israel?'

        shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild lettuce:'
      - They shall not leave any thing thereof until morning, nor break a bone thereof,
        they shall observe all the ceremonies of the phase.
      - 'But if any man is clean, and was not on a journey, and did not make the phase,
        that soul shall be cut off from among his people, because he offered not sacrifice
        to the Lord in due season: he shall bear his sin.'
      - The sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you, shall make the phase
        to the Lord according to the ceremonies and justifications thereof. The same
        ordinances shall be with you both for the stranger, and for him that was born

      - Now on the day that the tabernacle was reared up, a cloud covered it. But
        from the evening there was over the tabernacle, as it were, the appearance
        of fire until the morning.
      - 'So it was always: by day the cloud covered it, and by night as it were the
        appearance of fire.'
      - 'And when the cloud that covered the tabernacle was taken up, then the children

        kept the watches of the Lord, and marched not,
      - For as many days soever as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle. At the commandment
        of the Lord they pitched their tents, and at his commandment they took them
        down.
      - 'If the cloud tarried from evening until morning, and immediately at break
        of day left the tabernacle, they marched forward: and if it departed after
        a day and a night, they took down their tents.'
      - 'But if it remained over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a longer
        time, the children of Israel remained in the same place, and marched not:
        but immediately as soon as it departed, they removed the camp.'

      - Make thee two trumpets of beaten silver, wherewith thou mayest call together
        the multitude when the camp is to be removed.
      - And when thou shalt sound the trumpets, all the multitude shall gather unto
        thee to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant.
      - If thou sound but once, the princes and the heads of the multitude of Israel
        shall come to thee.
      - But if the sound of the trumpets be longer, and with interruptions, they that
        are on the east side, shall first go forward.
      - And at the second sounding and like noise of the trumpet, they who lie on
        the south side shall take up their tents. And after this manner shall the
        rest do, when the trumpets shall sound for a march.
      - But when the people is to be gathered together, the sound of the trumpets
        shall be plain, and they shall not make a broken sound.
      - 'And the sons of Aaron the priest shall sound the trumpets: and this shall
        be an ordinance for ever in your generations.'
      - If you go forth to war out of your land against the enemies that fight against
        you, you shall sound aloud with the trumpets, and there shall be a remembrance
        of you before the Lord your God, that you may be delivered out of the hands
        of your enemies.
      - If at any time you shall have a banquet, and on your festival days, and on
        the first days of your months, you shall sound the trumpets over the holocausts,
        and the sacrifices of peace offerings, that they may be to you for a remembrance
        of your God. I am the Lord your God.

        Enan.
      - This was the order of the camps, and marches of the children of Israel by

      - 'And Moses said to Hobab the son of Raguel the Madianite, his kinsman: We
        are going towards the place which the Lord will give us: come with us, that
        we may do thee good: for the Lord hath promised good things to Israel.'
      - 'But he answered him: I will not go with thee, but I will return to my country,
        wherein I was born.'
      - 'And he said: Do not leave us: for thou knowest in what places we should encamp
        in the wilderness, and thou shalt be our guide.'
      - And if thou comest with us, we will give thee what is the best of the riches

      - In the mean time there arose a murmuring of the people against the Lord, as

        And the fire of the Lord being kindled against them, devoured them that were
        at the uttermost part of the camp.
      - And when the people cried to Moses, Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire
        was swallowed up.
      - 'And he called the name of that place, The burning: for that the fire of the
        Lord had been kindled against them.'

      - Our soul is dry, our eyes behold nothing else but manna.
      - Now the manna was like coriander seed, of the colour of bdellium.
      - And the people went about, and gathering it, ground it in a mill, or beat
        it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot, and made cakes thereof of the taste
        of bread tempered with oil.
      - And when the dew fell in the night upon the camp, the manna also fell with
        it.
      - 'Now Moses heard the people weeping by their families, every one at the door
        of his tent. And the wrath of the Lord was exceedingly enkindled: to Moses

      - And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, taking away of the spirit
        that was in Moses, and giving to the seventy men. And when the spirit had
        rested on them they prophesied, nor did they cease afterwards.
      - Now there remained in the camp two of the men, of whom one was called Eldad,
        and the other Medad, upon whom the spirit rested; for they also had been enrolled,
        but were not gone forth to the tabernacle.

        saying: Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp.'

        because the cow was burnt for sin.'

      - 'The south side shall begin from the wilderness of Sin, which is by Edom:
        and shall have the most salt sea for its furthest limits eastward:'
      - Which limits shall go round on the south side by the ascent of the Scorpion
        and so into Senna, and reach toward the south as far as Cadesbarne, from whence
        the frontiers shall go out to the town called Adar, and shall reach as far
        as Asemona.
      - And the limits shall fetch a compass from Asemona to the torrent of Egypt,
        and shall end in the shore of the great sea.
      - And the west side shall begin from the great sea, and the same shall be the
        end thereof.

    verses:
      - ~
      - 'And the Lord spoke these things also to Moses in the plains of Moab by the
        Jordan, over against Jericho:'
      - Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites out of their
        possessions,
      - 'Cities to dwell in, and their suburbs round about: that they may abide in
        the towns, and the suburbs may be for their cattle and beasts:'
      - 'Which suburbs shall reach from the walls of the cities outward, a thousand
        paces on every side:'
      - 'Toward the east shall be two thousand cubits: and toward the south in like
        manner shall be two thousand cubits: toward the sea also, which looketh to
        the west, shall be the same extent: and the north side shall be bounded with
        the like limits. And the cities shall be in the midst, and the suburbs without.'
      - 'And among the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, six shall be separated
        for refuge to fugitives, that he who hath shed blood may flee to them: and
        besides these there shall be other forty-two cities,'
      - That is, in all forty-eight with their suburbs.
      - 'And of these cities which shall be given out of the possessions of the children
        of Israel, from them that have more, more shall be taken: and from them that
        have less, fewer. Each shall give towns to the Levites according to the extent
        of their inheritance.'
      - 'The Lord said to Moses:'
      - 'Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you shall
        have passed over the Jordan into the land of Chanaan,'
      - Determine what cities shall be for the refuge of fugitives, who have shed
        blood against their will.
      - And when the fugitive shall be in them, the kinsman of him that is slain may
        not have power to kill him, until he stand before the multitude, and his cause
        be judged.
      - And of those cities, that are separated for the refuge of fugitives,
      - Three shall be beyond the Jordan, and three in the land of Chanaan,
      - As well for the children of Israel as for strangers and sojourners, that he
        may flee to them, who hath shed blood against his will.
      - 'If any man strike with iron, and he die that was struck: he shall be guilty
        of murder, and he himself shall die.'
      - 'If he throw a stone, and he that is struck die: he shall be punished in the
        same manner.'
      - 'If he that is struck with wood die: he shall be revenged by the blood of
        him that struck him.'
      - 'The kinsman of him that was slain, shall kill the murderer: as soon as he
        apprehendeth him, he shall kill him.'
      - 'If through hatred any one push a man, or fling any thing at him with ill
        design:'
      - 'Or being his enemy, strike him with his hand, and he die: the striker shall
        be guilty of murder: the kinsman of him that was slain as soon as he findeth
        him, shall kill him.'
      - But if by chance medley, and without hatred,
      - And enmity, he do any of these things,
      - 'And this be proved in the hearing of the people, and the cause be debated
        between him that struck, and the next of kin:'
      - The innocent shall be delivered from the hand of the revenger, and shall be
        brought back by sentence into the city, to which he had fled, and he shall
        abide there until the death of the high priest, that is anointed with the
        holy oil.
      - If the murderer be found without the limits of the cities that are appointed
        for the banished,
      - 'And be struck by him that is the avenger of blood: he shall not be guilty
        that killed him.'
      - 'For the fugitive ought to have stayed in the city until the death of the
        high priest: and after he is dead, then shall the manslayer return to his
        own country.'
      - These things shall be perpetual, and for an ordinance in all your dwellings.
      - 'The murderer shall be punished by witnesses: none shall be condemned upon
        the evidence of one man.'
      - You shall not take money of him that is guilty of blood, but he shall die
        forthwith.
      - The banished and fugitives before the death of the high priest may by no means
        return into their own cities.
      - 'Defile not the land of your habitation, which is stained with the blood of
        the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that
        hath shed the blood of another.'
      - And thus shall your possession be cleansed, myself abiding with you. For I
        am the Lord that dwell among the children of Israel.

    verses:
      - ~
      - 'And the princes of the families of Galaad, the son of Machir, the son of
        Manasses, of the stock of the children of Joseph, came and spoke to Moses
        before the princes of Israel, and said:'
      - 'The Lord hath commanded thee, my lord, that thou shouldst divide the land
        by lot to the children of Israel, and that thou shouldst give to the daughters
        of Salphaad our brother the possession due to their father:'
      - Now if men of another tribe take them to wives, their possession will follow
        them, and being transferred to another tribe, will be a diminishing of our
        inheritance.
      - And so it shall come to pass, that when the jubilee, that is, the fiftieth
        year of remission, is come, the distribution made by the lots shall be confounded,
        and the possession of the one shall pass to the others.
      - 'Moses answered the children of Israel, and said by the command of the Lord:
        The tribe of the children of Joseph hath spoken rightly.'
      - 'And this is the law promulgated by the Lord touching the daughters of Salphaad:
        Let them marry to whom they will, only so that it be to men of their own tribe.'
      - 'Lest the possession of the children of Israel be mingled from tribe to tribe.
        For all men shall marry wives of their own tribe and kindred:'
      - 'And all women shall take husbands of the same tribe: that the inheritance
        may remain in the families.'
      - And that the tribes be not mingled one with another, but remain so
      - 'As they were separated by the Lord. And the daughters of Salphaad did as
        was commanded:'
      - And Maala, and Thersa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Noa were married to the
        sons of their uncle by their father
      - 'Of the family of Manasses, who was the son of Joseph: and the possession
        that had been allotted to them, remained in the tribe and family of their
        father.'
      - These are the commandments and judgment, which the Lord commanded by the hand
        of Moses to the children of Israel, in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan
        over against Jericho.
