book_intro: In this Epistle, the Apostle again instructs and admonishes Timothy in
  what belonged to his office, as in the former; and also warns him to shun the conversation
  of those who had erred from the truth, describing at the same time their character,
  He tells him of his approaching death and desires him to come speedily to him. It
  appears from this circumstance that he wrote this second Epistle in the time of
  his last imprisonment at Rome and not long before his martyrdom.
