book_intro: 'This Book takes its name from the holy man of whom it treats: who, according
  to the more probable opinion, was of the race of Esau; and the same as Jobab, king
  of Edom, mentioned Gen. 36.33. It is uncertain who was the writer of it. Some attribute
  it to Job himself; others to Moses, or some one of the prophets. In the Hebrew it
  is written in verse, from the beginning of the third chapter to the forty-second
  chapter.'

    verse:
      - ~
      - There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple
        and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.
      - And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
      - 'And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and
        five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceedingly
        great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.'
      - And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day. And sending,
        they called their three sisters, to eat and drink with them.
      - 'And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and
        sanctified them: and rising up early, offered holocausts for every one of
        them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God
        in their hearts. So did Job all days.'
      - Now on a certain day, when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord,
        Satan also was present among them.
      - 'And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I
        have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.'
      - 'And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there
        is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God,
        and avoiding evil?'
      - 'And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain?'
      - Hast thou not made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round
        about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on
        the earth?
      - But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if
        he bless thee not to thy face.
      - 'Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only
        put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence
        of the Lord.'
      - Now upon a certain day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking
        wine, in the house of their eldest brother,
      - 'There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the
        asses feeding beside them,'
      - And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the
        sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
      - 'And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell
        from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them;
        and I alone have escaped to tell thee.'
      - 'And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans
        made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them; moreover,
        they have slain the servants with the sword: and I alone have escaped to tell
        thee.'
      - 'He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters
        were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,'
      - 'A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the
        four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children, and they are dead:
        and I alone have escaped to tell thee.'
      - Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head, fell
        down upon the ground, and worshipped,
      - 'And said: Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return
        thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the
        Lord, so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.'
      - In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing
        against God.

    verse:
      - ~
      - And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of God came, and stood
        before the Lord, and Satan came amongst them, and stood in his sight,
      - 'That the Lord said to Satan: Whence comest thou? And he answered, and said:
        I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.'
      - 'And the Lord said to Satan: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there
        is none like him in the earth, a man simple and upright, and fearing God,
        and avoiding evil, and still keeping his innocence? But thou hast moved me
        against him, that I should afflict him without cause.'
      - 'And Satan answered, and said: Skin for skin; and all that a man hath, he
        will give for his life:'
      - But put forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and then thou shalt
        see that he will bless thee to thy face.
      - 'And the Lord said to Satan: Behold, he is in thy hand, but yet save his life.'
      - 'So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with a
        very grievous ulcer, from the sole of the foot even to the top of his head:'
      - And he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter, sitting on a dunghill.
      - 'And his wife said to him: Dost thou still continue in thy simplicity? bless
        God and die.'
      - 'And he said to her: Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women: If we
        have received good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil?
        In all these things Job did not sin with his lips.'
      - Now when Job’s three friends heard all the evil that had befallen him, they
        came every one from his own place, Eliphaz, the Themanite, and Baldad, the
        Suhite, and Sophar, the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment to come
        together and visit him, and comfort him.
      - And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not, and crying
        out, they wept, and rending their garments, they sprinkled dust upon their
        heads toward heaven.
      - 'And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights and no man
        spoke to him a word: for they saw that his grief was very great.'

        instances:
          - note: Job cursed the day of his birth, not by way of wishing evil to any
              thing of God’s creation; but only to express in a stronger manner his
              sense of human miseries in general, and of his own calamities in particular.
            quote: Cursed his day
    verse:
      - ~
      - After this, Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,
      - 'And he said:'
      - 'Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said:
        A man child is conceived.'
      - Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and
        let not the light shine upon it.
      - Let darkness, and the shadow of death, cover it, let a mist overspread it,
        and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.
      - Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the
        days of the year, nor numbered in the months.
      - Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.
      - 'Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to raise up a leviathan:'
      - 'Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light, and
        not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:'
      - Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils
        from my eyes.
      - Why did I not die in the womb? why did I not perish when I came out of the
        belly?
      - Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts?
      - 'For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep:'
      - 'With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:'
      - 'Or with princes, that possess gold, and fill their houses with silver:'
      - Or as a hidden untimely birth, I should not be; or as they that, being conceived,
        have not seen the light.
      - There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are
        at rest.
      - And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have not heard the voice
        of the oppressor.
      - The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.
      - Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in
        bitterness of soul?
      - 'That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:'
      - And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave?
      - To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness?
      - 'Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing waters, so is my roaring:'
      - 'For the fear which I feared, hath come upon me: and that which I was afraid
        of, hath befallen me.'
      - Have I not dissembled? have I not kept silence? have I not been quiet? and
        indignation is come upon me.

      - 'Fear seized upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were affrighted:'

      - There stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image before my eyes, and
        I heard the voice, as it were, of a gentle wind.
      - Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a man be more pure than
        his maker?
      - 'Behold, they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found
        wickedness:'

      - And I wish that God would speak with thee, and would open his lips to thee,
      - That he might shew thee the secrets of wisdom, and that his law is manifold,

      - He is higher than heaven, and what wilt thou do? he is deeper than hell, and
        how wilt thou know?
      - The measure of him is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.

        consider it?

        thou shalt sleep secure.
      - 'Thou shalt rest, and there shall be none to make thee afraid: and many shall
        entreat thy face.'
      - But the eyes of the wicked shall decay, and the way to escape shall fail them,
        and their hope the abomination of the soul.

        and was moved to indignation: now he was angry against Job, because he said

        speaking.

        teach wisdom.

        giveth understanding.

      - 'Lest you should say: We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man.'
      - He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your
        words.
      - They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking.
      - 'Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken: they stood, and
        answered no more:'
      - I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge.
      - For I am full of matter to speak of, and the spirit of my bowels straiteneth

      - Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new

        world which he made?
      - If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and breath unto himself.
      - All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return into ashes.

        of my words.
      - Can he be healed that loveth not judgment? and how dost thou so far condemn
        him that is just?

        in their stead.

      - He hath struck them, as being wicked, in open sight.
      - 'Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not understand
        all his ways:'
      - So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him, and he heard the
        voice of the poor.
      - For when he granteth peace, who is there that can condemn? When he hideth
        his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations,
        or all men?
      - Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people?
      - Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy turn.
      - 'If I have erred, teach thou me: if I have spoken iniquity, I will add no
        more.'
      - 'Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest
        to speak, and not I: but if thou know any thing better, speak.'
      - Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken to me.
      - But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline.
      - 'My father, let Job be tried even to the end: cease not from the man of iniquity.'
      - 'Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast in the mean
        time amongst us: and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches.'

      - 'For thou saidst: That which is right doth not please thee: or what will it
        profit thee if I sin?'
      - Therefore I will answer thy words, and thy friends with thee.
      - Look up to heaven and see, and behold the sky, that it is higher than thee.
      - If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt him? and if thy iniquities be multiplied,
        what shalt thou do against him?
      - And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give him, or what shall he receive
        of thy hand?
      - 'Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee: and thy justice may help
        the son of man.'

        for the violence of the arm of tyrants.'

        of every one.
      - 'Yea, when thou shalt say: He considereth not: be judged before him, and expect
        him.'
      - For he doth not now bring on his fury, neither doth he revenge wickedness
        exceedingly.

      - For God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he given her understanding.
      - 'When time shall be, she setteth up her wings on high: she scorneth the horse
        and his rider.'
      - Wilt thou give strength to the horse or clothe his neck with neighing?
      - Wilt thou lift him up like the locusts? the glory of his nostrils is terror.
      - He breaketh up the earth with his hoof, he pranceth boldly, he goeth forward
        to meet armed men.
      - He despiseth fear, he turneth not his back to the sword.
      - Above him shall the quiver rattle, the spear and shield shall glitter.
      - Chasing and raging he swalloweth the ground, neither doth he make account
        when the noise of the trumpet soundeth.
      - 'When he heareth the trumpet he saith: Ha, ha: he smelleth the battle afar
        off, the encouraging of the captains, and the shouting of the army.'
      - Doth the hawk wax feathered by thy wisdom, spreading her wings to the south?
      - Will the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest in high places?
      - She abideth among the rocks, and dwelleth among cragged flints, and stony
        hills, where there is no access.
      - From thence she looketh for the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
      - 'Her young ones shall suck up blood: and wheresoever the carcass shall be,
        she is immediately there.'
      - 'And the Lord went on, and said to Job:'
      - Shall he that contendeth with God be so easily silenced? surely he that reproveth
        God, ought to answer him.
      - 'Then Job answered the Lord, and said:'
      - What can I answer, who hath spoken inconsiderately? I will lay my hand upon
        my mouth.
      - 'One thing I have spoken, which I wish I had not said: and another, to which
        I will add no more.'

      - 'And the Lord answering Job out of the whirlwind, said:'
      - 'Gird up thy loins like a man: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.'
      - 'Wilt thou make void my judgment: and condemn me, that thou mayst be justified?'
      - And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
      - Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high, and be glorious, and
        put on goodly garments.
      - Scatter the proud in thy indignation, and behold every arrogant man, and humble
        him.
      - Look on all that are proud, and confound them, and crush the wicked in their
        place,
      - Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit.
      - Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.
      - Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass like an ox.
      - His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly.
      - He setteth up his tail like a cedar, the sinews of his testicles are wrapped
        together.
      - His bones are like pipes of brass, his gristle like plates of iron.
      - He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him, he will apply his sword.
      - 'To him the mountains bring forth grass: there all the beasts of the field
        shall play.'
      - He sleepeth under the shadow, in the covert of the reed, and in moist places.
      - The shades cover his shadow, the willows of the brook shall compass him about.
      - 'Behold, he will drink up a river, and not wonder: and he trusteth that the
        Jordan may run into his mouth.'
      - In his eyes as with a hook he shall take him, and bore through his nostrils
        with stakes.
      - Canst thou draw out the leviathan with a hook, or canst thou tie his tongue
        with a cord?
      - Canst thou put a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with a buckle?
      - Will he make many supplications to thee, or speak soft words to thee?
      - Will he make a covenant with thee, and wilt thou take him to be a servant
        for ever,
      - Shalt thou play with him as with a bird, or tie him up for thy handmaids?
      - Shall friends cut him in pieces, shall merchants divide him?
      - Wilt thou fill nets with his skin, and the cabins of fishes with his head?
      - 'Lay thy hand upon him: remember the battle, and speak no more.'
      - Behold his hope shall fail him, and in the sight of all he shall be cast down.

        heaven are mine.
      - I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication.
      - Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the midst of
        his mouth?
      - Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
      - His body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing upon one
        another.
      - 'One is joined to another, and not so much as any air can come between them:'
      - They stick one to another and they hold one another fast, and shall not be
        separated.
      - His sneezing is like the shining of fire, and his eyes like the eyelids of
        the morning.
      - Out of his mouth go forth lamps, like torches of lighted fire.
      - Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, like that of a pot heated and boiling.
      - His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh forth out of his mouth.
      - In his neck strength shall dwell, and want goeth before his face.
      - 'The members of his flesh cleave one to another: he shall send lightnings
        against him, and they shall not be carried to another place.'
      - His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith’s anvil,
      - When he shall raise him up, the angels shall fear, and being affrighted shall
        purify themselves.
      - When a sword shall lay at him, it shall not be able to hold, nor a spear,
        nor a breastplate.
      - For he shall esteem iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
      - The archer shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling are to him
        like stubble.
      - As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to scorn who shaketh
        the spear.
      - The beams of the sun shall be under him, and he shall strew gold under him
        like mire.
      - He shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot, and shall make it as when ointments
        boil.
      - A path shall shine after him, he shall esteem the deep as growing old.
      - There is no power upon earth that can be compared with him who was made to
        fear no one,
      - He beholdeth every high thing, he is king over all the children of pride.
  - chapter_intro: Job submits himself. God pronounces in his favour. Job offers sacrifice
      for his friends. He is blessed with riches and children, and dies happily,
    chapter_number: 42
    verse:
      - ~
      - 'Then Job answered the Lord, and said:'
      - I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.
      - Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken
        unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.
      - 'Hear, and I will speak: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.'
      - With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.
      - Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.
      - 'And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the
        Themanite: My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends,
        because you have not spoken the thing that is right before me, as my servant
        Job hath.'
      - 'Take unto you therefore seven oxen and seven rams, and go to my servant Job,
        and offer for yourselves a holocaust, and my servant Job shall pray for you:
        his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you: for you have not
        spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath.'
      - So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite
        went, and did as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord accepted the face
        of Job.
      - The Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he prayed for his friends.
        And the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
      - 'And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew
        him before, and they ate bread with him in his house: and bemoaned him, and
        comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought upon him. And every man
        gave him one ewe, and one earring of gold.'
      - And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he
        had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke
        of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
      - And he had seven sons, and three daughters.
      - And he called the name of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, and
        the name of the third Cornustibii.
      - 'And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as the daughters
        of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.'
      - And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and he saw his
        children, and his children’s children, unto the fourth generation, and he
        died an old man, and full of days.
