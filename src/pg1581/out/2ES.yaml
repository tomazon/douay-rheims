      - 'Goe, and tel my people their wicked deedes, and their children the iniquities,
        that they haue done against me, that they may tel their childrens children:'
      - because the sinnes of their parentes are increased in them, for they being
        forgetful of me haue sacrified to strange goddes.
      - Did not I bring them out of the land of AEgypt from the house of bondage?
        But they haue prouoked me, & haue despised my counsels.

        peoples of two prouinces Tyre and Sidon, and I slew al their aduersaries.

        riuer of the Amorrheites, and blasphemeing my name,<cross_ref>Ex 15:25</cross_ref>'

        the riuer swete.
      - What shal I doe to thee Iacob? Thou wouldest not obey o Iuda. I wil transferre

      - 'Because you haue forsaken me, I aslo forsake you: when you aske mercie of
        me, I wil not haue mercie.<cross_ref>Isa 1:15</cross_ref>'
      - When you shal inuocate me, I wil not heare you. For you haue defiled your
        handes with bloud, and your fete are quicke to commit murders.
      - Not as though you haue forsaken me, but yourselues, sayth our Lord.
      - Thus saith our Lord omnipotent, haue not I desired you, as a father his sonnes,
        and a mother her daughters, and as a nurce her litle ones,
      - that you would be my people, and I your God, and to me for children, and I
        to you for a father?
      - So haue I gathered you, as the henne her chickenes vnder her winges. But now
        what shal I doe to you? I wil throw you from my face.<cross_ref>Matt 23:37</cross_ref>
      - When you shal bring me oblation, I wil turne away my face from you.<cross_ref>Isa
        66:5</cross_ref> For I haue refused your festiual dayes, & newmoones, and
        circumcisions.
      - I sent my seruantes the prophetes to you, whom being taken you slew, and mangled
        their bodies, whose bloud I wil require, sayth our Lord.

        to whom I haue not shewed signes, they wil do the thinges that I haue commanded.'
      - The prophetes they haue not sene, and they wil be mindful of their iniquities.
      - I cal to witnes the grace of the people comming, whose litle ones reioyce
        with ioy, not seing me with their carnal eyes, but in spirit beleuing the
        thinges that I haue sayd.

      - ~
      - 'IN the thirteth yeare of the ruine of the citie I was in Babylon, and was
        trubled lying in my chamber, and my cogitations came vp ouer my hart:'

        in Babylon.
      - And my spirit was tossed excedingly, and I began to speake to the highest
        timorous wordes,

        plant the earth, and that alone, and didst rule ouer the people,<cross_ref>Gen
        1</cross_ref>'
      - 'and gauest Adam a dead bodie: but that also was the worke of thy handes,
        & didst breath into him the spirit of life, and he was made to liue before
        thee:<cross_ref>Gen 2:7</cross_ref>'
      - and thou broughst him into paradise, which thy right hand had planted, before
        the earth came.
      - And him thou didst command to loue thy way, and he transgressed it, & forth
        with thou didst institute death in him, and in his posteritie, and there were
        borne nations, and tribes, and peoples, and kindreds, wherof there is no number.

        thee, and despised thy preceptes.
      - And agane in time thou broughst in the floud vpon inhabitantes of the world,
        and didst destroy them.<cross_ref>Gen 7</cross_ref>
      - And there was made in euery one of them, as vnto Adam to dye, so to them the
        floud,

        iust.
      - 'And it came to passe, when they began to be multiplied, that dwelt vpon the

        againe to doe impietie more then the former.'
      - And it came to passe when they did iniquitie before thee, thou didst choose
        thee a man of them whose name was Abraham.

        12</cross_ref>
      - And thou didst dispose vnto him an euerlasting testament, and toldst him that
        thou wouldst neuer forsake his seede. And thou gauest him Issac, and to Isaac
        thou gauest Iacob and Esau.

        Iacob grewe to a great multitude.
      - And it came to passe when thou didst bring forth his sede out of AEgypt, thou
        broughst it vpon mount Sinai.<cross_ref>Ex 19</cross_ref>
      - And thou didst bowe the heauens, and fasten the earth, and didst shake the
        world, and madest the depthes to tremble, and trubledst the world,
      - and thy glorie passed foure gates of fire, and of earthquake, and winde, and
        frost, that thou mightst geue a law to the seede of Iacob, and to the generation
        of Israel diligence.
      - And thou didst not take away from them a malignant hart, that thy law might
        bring forth fruite in them.
      - For Adam the first bearing a vicious hart transgressed and was ouercome, yea
        and al that were borne of him.
      - And it was made a permanent infirmitie, and the law with the hart of the people,
        with the wickednes of the roote, and that which is good departed, and the
        wicked remayned.
      - 'And the times passed, & the yeares were ended: and thou didst raise vp vnto
        thee a seruant named Dauid,'
      - and spakest vnto him to build a citie of thy name, and to offer vnto thee
        in it frankencense, and oblations.
      - And this was done manie yeares, and they that inhabited the citie forsooke
        thee,
      - in al things as Adam and al his generations. For they also vsed a wicked hart.
      - And thou didst deliuer thy citie into the hands of thyne enimies.
      - Why, doe they better thinges, that inhabite Babylon? And for this shal she
        rule ouer Sion?<cross_ref>Jer 12</cross_ref>
      - 'It came to passe when I was come hither, and had sene the impieties that
        can not be numbred: and my soul saw manie offending this thirteth yeare, &
        my hart was astonied:'
      - because I saw how thou bearest with their sinne, and didst spare them that
        did impiously, and didst destroy thine owne people, and preserue thine enimies,
        and didst not signifie it.
      - 'I nothing remember how this way should be forsaken: doth Babylon better thinges
        then Sion?'
      - 'Or hath anie nation knowen thee beside Israel: or what tribes haue beleued
        thy testamentes as Iacob?'
      - Whose reward hath not appeared, nor their labour fructified. For passing through
        I passed among the nations, and I saw them abound, and not mindeful of thy
        commandmentes.
      - 'Now therfore wey our iniquities in a ballance, and theirs that dwel in the
        world: & thy name shal not be found, but in Israel.'
      - Or when haue not they sinned in thy sight, that inhabite the earth? or what
        nation hath so obserued thy commandmentes?
      - These certes by their names thou shalt finde to haue kept thy commandments,
        but the nations thou shalt not finde.
  - chapter_intro: Mans witte and reason is not able to vnderstand the counsel and
      iudgement of God, 22. why his people are afflicted by wicked nations, 33. nor
      of times, and thinges to come.
    chapter_number: 4
    verse:
      - ~
      - AND the Angel answered me, that was sent to me, whose name was Vriel,
      - 'and sayd to me: Thy hart exceding hath exceded in this world, & thou thinkest
        to comprehend the way of the Highest.'
      - 'And I sayd: It is so my Lord. And he answered me, & sayd: I am sent to shew
        thee three wayes, & to propose to thee three similitudes.'
      - Of the which if thou shalt declare to me one of them, I also wil shew thee
        the way which thou desirest to see, and wil teach thee whence a wicked hart
        is.
      - 'And I sayd, Speak my Lord. And he sayd to me: Goe, wey me the weight of the
        fire, or measure me the blast of the winde, or cal me backe the day that is
        past.'
      - 'And I answered, and sayd: what man borne can doe it, that thou askest me
        of these thinges?'
      - 'And he sayd to me: If I should aske thee, saying: How great habitations are
        there in the hart of the sea, or how great vaines be there in the beginning
        of the depth, or how great vaines be there aboue the firmament, and what are
        the issues of paradise:'
      - 'thou wouldest perhaps say to me: I haue not descended into the depth, nor
        into hel as yet, neither haue I ascended at anie time into heauen.'
      - 'But now I haue not asked thee, sauing of the fire, and the winde, and the
        day by the which thou hast passed, and from the which thou canst not be separated:
        and thou hast not answered me of them.'
      - 'And he sayd to me: Thou canst not know the thinges that are thine which grow
        together with thee:'
      - 'and how can thy vessel comprehend the way of the Highest, and now the world
        being outwardly corrupted, vnderstand the corruption euident in my sight:'
      - 'I sayd to him: Better were it for vs not to be, then yet liuing to liue in
        impieties, and to suffer, and not to vnderstand for what thing.'
      - 'And he answered me, & said: Going forth I went forward to a wood of trees
        in the filde, and they deuised a deuise,<cross_ref>Judges 9 / 2 Par 25</cross_ref>'
      - 'and said: Come and let vs goe, and make warre against the sea, that it may
        retyre backe before vs, and we may make vs other woodes.'
      - 'And in like maner the waues of the sea they also deuised a deuise, and sayd:
        Come let vs goe vp, let vs ouerthrow the woodes of the filde, that there also
        we may consummate an other countrie for our selues.'
      - And the woodes deuise was made vaine, for fire came, and consumed it.
      - Likewise also the deuise of the waues of the sea. For the sand stood, & stayed
        them.
      - For if thou wert iudge of these, whom wouldest thou begin to iustifie, or
        whom to condemne?
      - 'And I answered, and sayd: Verely they deuised a vayne deuise. For the earth
        is geuen to the wood, and a place to the sea to carie her waues.'
      - 'And he answered me, and sayed: Thou hast iudged wel, and why hast thou not
        iudged for thy self?'
      - 'For as the earth is geuen to the wood, and the sea for the waues therof:
        so they that inhabite vpon the earth, can vnderstand onlie the thinges that
        are vpon the earth: and they vpon the heauens, the thinges that are aboue
        the height of the heauens.'
      - 'And I answered, and sayd: I besech thee Lord, that sense may be geuen me

      - 'For who witting wil enter into the sea, and see it, or rule ouer it: if he
        passe not the streite, how shal he come into the bredth?'
      - 'Also an other thing: A citie is built, and set in a plaine place, and it
        is ful of al goodes.'
      - 'The entrance therof narrow, and set in a stepe place, so that on the right
        hand there was fire, & on the left depe water:'
      - and there is one onlie pathe set betwen them, that is, betwen the fire and
        the water, so that the pathe can not conteyne, but onlie a mans steppe.
      - And if the citie shal be geuen a man for inheritance, if he neuer passe through
        the peril set before it, how shal he receiue his inhertance?
      - 'And I sayd: So Lord. And he sayd to me, So it is: Israel also a part.'
      - 'For I made the world for them: and when Adam transgressed my constitution,
        that was iudged which was done.'
      - And the entrance of this world were made streite, and sorowful, & paynful,
        and few and euil, and ful of dangers, & stuffed very much with labour.
      - For the entrances of the greater world are large andsecure, and making fruite
        of immortalitie.
      - 'If then they that liue entring in enter into these streite and vayne thinges:
        they can not receiue the thinges that are layd vp.'
      - Now therfore why art thou trubled, wheras thou art corruptible? and why art
        thou moued, wheras thou art mortal?
      - And why hast thou not taken in thy hart that which is to come, but that which
        is present?
      - 'I answered, and sayd: Lord dominatour: behold thou hast disposed by thy law
        that the iust shal inherite these thinges, and the impious shal perish.<cross_ref>Deut
        8</cross_ref>'
      - But the iust shal suffer the streites, hoping for the wyde places, for they
        that haue done impiously, haue both suffered the streites, and shal not see
        the wide places.
      - 'And he sayd to me: There is no iudge aboue God, nor that vnderstandeth aboue
        the Highest.'
      - For manie present doe perish, because the law of God which was set before,
        is neglected.
      - For God commanding commanded them that came, when they came, what doing they
        should liue, and what obseruing they should not be punished.
      - But they were not perswaded, and gaynesayd him, and made to them selues a
        cogitation of vanitie,
      - and proposed to them selues deceites of sinnes, & they sayd to the Highest
        that he was not, and they knew not his wayes,
      - and dispised his law, and denyed his couenaunces, and had not fidelitie in
        his ordinances, and did not accomplish his workes.
      - For this cause Esdras, the emptie to the emptie, and the ful to the ful.
      - 'Behold the time shal come, and it shal be when the signes shal come, which
        I haue foretold thee, and the bride shal appeare, and appearing she shal be
        shewed that now is hid with the earth:'
      - and euerie one that is deliuered from the foresaid euils, he shal see my meruelous
        thinges.
      - For my sonne IESVS shal be reueled with them that are with him, and they shal
        be merie that are leaft in the foure hundred yeares.
      - 'And it shal be after these yeares, and my sonne CHRIST shal dye: and al men
        that haue breath,'
      - and the world shal be turned into the old silence seuen dayes, as in the former
        iudgementes, so that none shal be leaft.
      - 'And it shal be after seuen dayes, and the world shal be raysed vp that yet
        waketh not, and shal dye corrupted:'
      - and the earth shal render the thinges that sleepe in it, & the dust them that
        dwel in it with silence, and the cellars shal render the soules that are commended
        to them.
      - And the Highest shal be reueled vpon the seate of iudgement, and miseries
        shal passe, and long sufferance shal be gathered together.
      - And iudgement onlie shal remayne, truth shal stand, and fayth shal waxe strong,
      - and the worke shal folow, and the reward shal be shewed, and iustice shal
        awake, and iniustice shal not haue dominion. [See note below.]
      - 'And I sayd: First Abraham prayed for the Sodomites, and Moyses for the fathers
        that sinned in the desert.<cross_ref>Gen 18 / Ex 32</cross_ref>'

      - 'If therfore now when corruptible did increase, and iniustice was multiplied,
        and the iust prayed for the impious: why now also shal it not be so?'
      - 'And he answered me and sayd: This present world is not the end, much glorie
        remaineth in it: for this cause they prayed for the impotent.'
      - 'For the day of iudgement shal be the end of this time, and the beginning
        of the immortalitie to come, wherein corruption is past:'
      - 'intemperance is dissolued, incredulitie is cut of: and iustice hath increased,
        truth is strong.'
      - For then no man can saue him that hath perished, nor drowne him that hath
        ouercome. And I answered,
      - 'and sayd: This is my word the first and the last, that it had bene better
        not to geue the earth to Adam, or when he had now geuen it, to restraine him
        that he should not sinne.'
      - For what doth it profit men presently to liue in sorow, and being dead to
        hope for punishment?
      - O what hast thou done Adam? For if thou didst sinne, it was not made thy fal
        only, but ours also which came of thee.<cross_ref>Rom 5:12</cross_ref>
      - 'For what doth it profit vs if immortal time be promised to vs: but we haue
        done mortal workes?'
      - 'And that euerlasting hope is foretold vs: but we most wicked are become vayne?'
      - And that habitations of health and securitie are reserued for vs, but we haue
        conuerst naughtely?
      - 'And that the glorie of the Highest is reserued to protect them that haue
        slowly conuerst: but we haue walked in most wicked wayes.'
      - 'And that paradise shal be shewed, whose fruite continueth incorrupted, wherin
        is securitie and remedie:'
      - 'but we shal not enter in: for we haue conuerst in vnlawful places.'
      - 'And their faces which haue had abstinence, shal shyne aboue the starres:
        but our faces blacke aboue darkenes.'
      - For we did not thinke liuing when we did iniquitie, that we shal beginne after
        death to suffer.
      - 'And he answered, and sayd: This is the cogitation of the battel which man
        shal fight, who is borne vpon the earth,'
      - 'that if he shal be ouercome, he suffer that which thou hast sayd: but if
        he ouercome he shal receiue that which I say:'

        saying: Choose vnto thee life, that thou mayst liue.<cross_ref>Deut 30:19</cross_ref>'
      - But they beleued him not, no nor the Prophetes after him, no nor me which
        haue spoken to them.
      - Because there should not be sorow vnto their perdition, as there shal be ioy
        vpon them, to whom saluation is perswaded.
      - 'And I answered, and sayd: I know Lord, that the Highest is called merciful
        in that, that he hath mercie on them which are not yet come into the world,'
      - 'and that he hath mercie on them which conuerse in his law:'
      - 'and he is long suffering, because he sheweth long sufferance to them that
        haue sinned, as it were with their owne workes:'

      - and of freat mercie, because he multiplieth more mercies to them that are
        present, and that are past, and that are to come.
      - For if he shal not multiplie his mercies, the world shal not be made aliue
        with them that did inherite it.
      - 'And he geueth: for if he shal not geue of his bountie, that they may be releeued
        which haue done iniquitie, the tenth thousand part of men can not be quickned
        from their iniquities.'
      - 'And the iudge if he shal not forgeue them that are cured with his word, and

      - ~
      - 'AND he answered me, & sayd: This world the Highest made for manie, but that
        to come for few.'
      - 'And I wil speake a similitude Esdras before thee. For as thou shalt aske
        the earth, and it wil tel thee, that it wil geue much more earth wherof earthen
        worke may be made, but a litle dust wherof gold is made: so also is the act
        of this present world.'
      - Manie in deede are created, but few shal be saued.<cross_ref>Matt 20:16</cross_ref>
      - 'And I answered, and sayd: Then o soul swallow vp the sense, and deuoure that
        which is wise.'
      - For thou art agred to obey, and willing to prophecie. For there is no space
        geuen thee but only to liue.
      - O Lord if thou wilt not permitte thy seruant, that we pray before thee, and
        thou geue vs seede to the hart, and tillage to the vnderstanding, wherof may
        the fruite be made, wherby euerie corrupt person may liue, that shal beare
        the place of a man?
      - 'For thou art alone, and we are one workmanshippe of thy handes, as thou hast
        spoken:'
      - 'and as now the bodie made in the matrice, and thou doest geue the members,
        thy creature is preserued in fire & water: and nine monethes thy workemanship
        doth suffer thy creature that is created in it:'
      - 'and it self that keepeth, and that which is kept, both shal be preserued:
        and the matrice being preserued rendreth agayne at some time the thinges that
        are growen in it.'
      - For thou hast commanded of the members, that is the brestes to geue milke
        vnto the fruite of the brestes,
      - that the thing which is made, may be nourished til a certayne time, and afterward
        thou mayst dispose him to thy mercie.
      - 'For thou hast, brought him vp in thy iustice, and hast instructed him in
        thy law, and hast corrected him in thy vnderstanding:'
      - 'and thou shalt mortifie him, as thy creature: and shalt geue him life, as
        thy worke.'
      - 'If then thou wilt destroy him that is made with so great labours: it is easie
        by thy commandment to be ordayned, that also which was made, might be preserued.'
      - 'And now Lord I wil speake, of euerie man thou rather knowest: but concerning
        thy people, for which I am sorowful:'
      - and concerning thine inheritance, for which I mourne, and for Israel for whom
        I am pensiue, and concerning Iacob, for whom I am sorowful.
      - 'Therfore wil I begin to pray before thee for me, & for them: because I see
        our defaultes that inhabite the earth.'
      - But I haue heard of the celeritie of the iudge that shal be.
      - Therfore heare my voyce, and vnderstand my word, and I wil speake before thee.
      - 'The beginning of the wordes of Esdras before he was assumpted: and I sayd:
        Lord which inhabitest the world, whose eyes are eleuated vnto thinges on high
        and in the ayre:'
      - 'and whose throne is inestimable, and glorie incomprehensible: by whom standeth
        an host of Angels with trembling,'
      - 'whose keping is turned in wynde and fire, thou whose word is true, and sayings
        premanent:'
      - 'whose commandment is strong, and disposition terrible: whose looke dryeth
        vp the depthes, and indignation maketh the mountaynes to melt, and truth doth
        testifie.'
      - Heare the prayer of thy seruant, & with thine eares receiue the petition of
        thy creature.
      - 'For whiles I liue, I wil speake: and whiles I vnderstand, I wil answere:'
      - Neither doe thou respect the sinnes of thy people, but them that serue thee
        in truth.
      - Neither doe thou attend the impious endeuours of the nations, but them that
        with sorowes haue kept thy testimonies.
      - Neither thinke thou of them that in thy sight haue conuerst falsly, but remember
        them that according to thy wil haue knowen thy feare.
      - 'Neither be thou willing to destroy them that haue had the maners of beastes:
        but respect them that haue taught thy law gloriously.'
      - 'Neither haue indignation towards them, which are iudged worse then beastes:
        but loue them that alwayes haue confidence in thy iustice, and glorie.'
      - 'Because we and our fatheres languish with such diseases: but thou for sinners
        shalt be called merciful.'
      - For if thou shalt be desirous to haue mercie on vs, then thou shalt be called
        merciful, to vs hauing no workes of iustice.
      - For the iust which haue manie workes layd vp, of their owne workes shal receiue
        reward.
      - 'For what is man, that thou art angrie with him: or the corruptible kinde,
        that thou art so bitter touching it?'
      - For in truth there is no man of them that be borne, which hath not done impiously,
        and of them that confesse, which haue not sinned.<cross_ref>3 Kings 8:46 /
        2 Par 6:36</cross_ref>
      - For in this shal thy iustice be declared, and thy goodnes, o Lord, when thou
        shalt haue mercie on them, that haue no substance of good workes.
      - 'And he answered me, and sayd: Thou hast spoken somethinges rightly: and according
        to thy wordes, so also shal it be done,'
      - 'because I wil not in dede thinke vpon the worke of them that haue sinned
        before death, before the iudgement, before perdition:'
      - but I wil reioyce vpon the creature of the iust, and I wil remember their
        pilgrimage also, and saluation, and receiuing of reward.
      - Therfore as I haue spoken, so also it is.
      - 'For as the husbandman soweth vpon the ground manie seedes, and planteth manie
        plantes, but not al which were sowen in time, are preserued, nor yet al that
        were planted, shal take roote: so they also that are sowen in the world, shal
        not al be saued.<cross_ref>Matt 13 & 20</cross_ref>'
      - 'And I answered, and sayd: If I haue found grace, let me speake.'
      - 'As the seede of the husbandman, if it come not vp, or receiue not the rayne
        in time, if it be corupted with much rayne, perisheth:'
      - 'so likewise also man who made with thy handes, and thou named his image:
        because thou art likened to him, for whom thou hast made al thinges, and hast
        likened him to the seede of the husbandman.'
      - Be not angrie vpon vs, but spare thy people, and haue mercie on thy inheritance.
        And thou hast mercie on thy creature.
      - 'And he answered me, and sayd: The thinges that are present to them that are
        present, and that shal be, to them that shal be.'
      - 'For thou lackest much to be able to loue my creature aboue me: and to thee
        often times, euen to thyselfe I haue approched, but to the vniust neuer.'
      - But in this also thou art meruelous before the Highest,
      - 'because thou hast humbled thyself as becometh thee: & hast not iudged thyself,
        that among the iust thou maist be very much glorified.'
      - 'For which cause manie miseries, and miserable thinges shal be done to them
        that inhabite the world in the later dayes: because they haue walked in much
        pride.'
      - But thou for thyselfe vnderstand, & for them that are like vnto thee seeke
        glorie.
      - For to you paradise is open, the tree of life is planted, time to come is
        prepared, abundance is prepared, a citie is builded, rest is approued, goodnes
        is perfited, & perfit wisdome.
      - 'The roote of euil is signed from you: infirmitie, and mothe is hid from you:
        & corruption is fled into hel in obliuion.'
      - Sorowes are past, & the treasure of immortalitie is shewed in the end.
      - Adde not therfore inquiring of the multitude of them that perish.
      - For they also receiuing libertie, haue despised the Highest, and contemned
        his lawe, and forsaken his wayes.
      - Yea and moreouer they haue troden downe his iust ones,
      - 'and haue sayd in their hart, that there is no God: and that, knowing that
        they dye.<cross_ref>Ps 13 & 52</cross_ref>'
      - 'For as the thinges aforesayd shal receiue you: so thirst and torment, which

      - 'But they them selues also which are created, haue defyled his name which
        made them: & haue bene vnkind to him that prepared life.'
      - Wherfore my iudgement now approcheth.
      - 'Which thinges I haue not shewed to al, but to thee, & to few like vnto thee.
        And I answered, and sayd:'
      - 'Behold now Lord thou hast shewed me a multitude of signes, which thou wilt
        beginne to doe in the latter times: but thou hast not shewed me at what time.'

        are spoken of before shal passe,'
      - then shalt thou vnderstand, that the same is the time wherin the Highest wil
        beginne to visite the world that was made by him.
      - And when there shal be sene in the world mouing of places, and truble of peoples,
      - then shalt thou vnderstand, that of these spake the Highest, from the dayes
        that were before thee, from the beginning.
      - 'For as al that is made in the world hath a beginning, and also a consummation,
        and the consummation is manifest:'
      - so also the times of the Highest haue the beginning manifest in wonders and
        powers, and the consummations in worke and in signes.
      - And it shal be, euery one that shal be saued, and that can escape by his workes,
        and by fayth, in which you haue beleeued,
      - shal be leaft out of the foresayd dangers, and shal see my saluation in my
        land, and in my costes, because I haue sancitifed my selfe from the world.
      - 'And then shal they be in miserie, that now haue abused my wayes: and they
        that haue reiected them in contempt, shal abide in torments.'
      - 'For they that knew not me, hauing obtained benefits when they liued:'
      - and they that loathed my law, when they yet had libertie,
      - 'and when as yet place of penance was open to them vnderstoode not, but despised:
        they must after death in torment know it.'
      - 'Thou therfore be not yet curious, how the impious shal be tormented: but
        inquire how the iust shal be saued, and whose the world is, and for whom the
        world is, and when.'
      - 'And I answered, and sayd:'

        are more which perish then that shal be saued:<cross_ref>Matt 10</cross_ref>'

        the flovvers, such also the colours: and as the workeman, such also the worke:
        and such as the husbandman, such is the husbandrie: because it was the time
        of the world.'
      - 'And now when I was preparing for them, for these that now are before the
        world was made, wherin they should dwel: and no man gaynsayd me.'
      - For then euery man, and now the creator in this world prepared, and haruest

      - And I considered the world, and behold there was danger because of the cogitations
        that came in it.
      - 'And I saw, and spared it very much: and I kept vnto my selfe a grape kernel
        of a cluster, and a plant of a great trybe.'
      - 'Let the multitude therfore perish, which was borne without cause, and let

        wine thou shalt not drinke, but only flowers.'
      - Pray to the Highest without intermission, and I wil come, and wil speake with

      - And I went forth, as he sayd to me, into a field which is called Ardath, and
        I sate there among the flowers. And I did eate of the herbes of the field,
        and the meate of them made me ful.
      - And it came to passe after seuen dayes, and I sate downe vpon the grasse,

        destroyed withal, and the thinges receiued now tarye not with vs: but it is
        not so done to vs.'

        and saw a woman on the right side, and behold she mourned, and wept with a
        lowd voice, and was sorrowful in mynde exceedingly, and her garments rent,

      - 'And I left the cogitations, wherin I was thinking, and I turned to her and
        sayd to her:'

      - 'Suffer me my Lord, that I may lament myselfe, & adde sorrow: because I am
        of a very pensiue mynde, and am humbled exceedingly.'
      - 'And I sayd to her, What ayleth thee: tel me. And she sayd to me:'
      - I thy seruant haue beene barren, and haue not borne childe, hauing a husband
        thirty yeares.
      - For I euery howre, and euerie day, and these thirty yeares do beseche the
        Highest night and day.
      - 'And it came to passe, after thirtie yeares God heard me thy handmayd, and
        saw my humilitie, and attended to my tribulation, and gaue me a sonne: and
        I was very ioyful vpon him, and my husband, and al my citizens, and we did
        glorifie the Strong exceedingly.'
      - And I nourished him with much labour.
      - And it came to passe when he was growen, and came to take a wife, I made a
        feast day.

    verse:
      - ~
      - 'AND it came to passe, when my sonne was entred into his inner chamber, he
        fel downe, and dyed:'
      - and we al ouerthrewe the lights, and al my citizens rose vp to comfort me,
        and I was quiet vntil the other day at night.
      - 'And it came to passe, when al were quiet to comfort me, that I might be quiet:
        and I arose in the night, and fled: and came as thou seest into this field.'
      - 'And I meane nowe not to returne into the citie, but to stay here: and neither
        eate, nor drinke, but without intermission to mourne, and to fast vntil I
        dye.'
      - 'And I left the talke wherin I was, and with anger answered her, & sayd:'
      - Thou foole aboue al wemen, seest thou not our mourning, & what thinges chance
        to vs?
      - Because Sion our mother is sorroweful with al sorrowe, and humbled, and mourneth
        most bitterly.
      - 'And now wheras we al mourne, and are sadde: wheras we are sorrowful, and
        art thou sorrowful for one sonne?'
      - 'For aske the earth, and it wil tel thee: that it is she, that ought to lament
        the fal of so manie thinges that spring vpon it.'
      - 'And of her were al borne from the beginning, and others shal come: and behold,
        almost al walke into perdition, and the multitude of them commeth to destruction.'
      - And who then ought to mourne more, but she that hath lost so great a multitude,
        rather then thou which art sorie for one?
      - 'And if thou say vnto me, that my mourning is not lyke the earthes: because
        I haue lost the fruite of my wombe, which I bare with sorrowes, and brought
        forth with paynes:'
      - 'but the earth according to the maner of the earth, and the present multitude
        in it hath departed as it came: and I saye to thee,'
      - as thou hast brought forth with payne, so the earth also geueth her fruite
        for man from the beginning to him that made her.
      - Now therfore kepe in with thy sorrowe, and beare stoutly the chances that
        haue befallen thee.
      - For if thou iustifie the end of God, thou shalt in time both receiue his counsel,
        and also in such thinges thou shalt be praysed.
      - 'Goe in therfore into the citie to thy husband. And she sayd to me:'
      - I wil not doe it, neither wil I enter into the citie, but here wil I dye.
      - 'And I added yet to speake to her, & sayd:'
      - Doe not this word, but consent to him that counseleth thee. For how manie
        are the chances of Sion? Take comfort for the sorrowe of Ierusalem.
      - For thou seest that our sanctification is made desert, and our altar is throwen
        downe, and our temple is destroyed,
      - 'and our psalter is humbled, and hymne is silent, and our exultation is dissolued,
        and the light of our candelsticke is extinguished, and the arke of our testament
        is taken for spoyle, & our holie thinges are contaminated, and the name that
        is inuocated vpon vs, is almost prophaned: and our children haue suffred contumelie,
        and our Priestes are burnt, & our Leuites are gone into captiuitie, & our
        virgins are defloured, and our wiues haue suffered rape, and our iust men
        are violently taken, and our litle ones are lost, and our yong men are in
        bondage, and our valiants are made impotent:'
      - 'and that which is greatest of al, the seale of Sion, because she is vnsealed
        of her glorie: For she is also deliuered into the handes of them that hate
        vs.'
      - Thou therfore shake of thy great heauines, and lay away from thee the multitude
        of sorrowes, that the Strong may be propicious to thee agayne, and the Highest
        wil geue thee rest, rest from thy labours.
      - And it came to passe, when I spake to her, her face did shine suddenly, and
        her shape, and her visage was made glistering, so that I was afrayde excedingly
        at her, & thought what this thing should be.
      - 'And Behold, suddenly she put forth a great sound of a voyce ful of feare,
        that the earth was moued at the womans sound. And I saw:'
      - 'and behold, the woman did no more appeare vnto me, but a citie was built,
        & a place was shewed of great fundations: and I was afrayd, & crying with
        a loude voyce I sayd:'
      - Where is Vriel the Angel, that from the beginning came to me? for he made
        me come in multitude in excesse of this minde, and my end is made into corruption,
        & my prayer into reproch.
      - And when I was speaking these thinges, behold he came to me, and sawe me.
      - 'And behold I was layd as dead, & my vnderstanding was alienated, and he held
        my right hand, and strengthned me, & set me vpon my feete, & sayd to me:'
      - 'What ayleth thee? and why is thy vnderstanding, and the sense of thy hart
        trubled, & why art thou trubled? And I sayd:'
      - 'Because thou hast forsaken me, and I in dede haue done according to thy wordes,
        & went out into the field: & behold, I haue seene, & doe see that which I
        cannot vtter. And he sayd to me:'
      - 'Stand like a man, & I wil moue thee. And I sayd:'
      - 'Speake thou my Lord in me, forsake me not, that I die not in vaine:'
      - because I haue seene thinges that I knew not, & I doe heare thinges that I
        know not.
      - Or is my sense deceiued, & doth my soule dreame?
      - 'Now therfore I besech thee, that thou shew vnto thy seruant concerning this
        trance. And he answered me, & sayd:'
      - 'Heare me, and I wil teach thee, and wil tel thee of what thinges thou art
        afrayd: because the Highest hath reuealed vnto thee manie mysteries.'
      - He hath seene thy right way, that without intermission thou was forrowful
        for thy people, and didst mourne exceedingly for Sion.
      - This therfore is the vnderstanding of the vision which appeared to thee a
        litle before.
      - The woman whom thou sawest mourning, thou beganst to comfort her.
      - And now thou seest not the forme of the woman, but there appeared to thee
        a citie to be built.
      - And because she tolde thee of the fal of her sonne, this is the interpretation.
      - This woman which thou sawest, she is Sion, and wheras she told thee of her,
        whom now also thou shalt see, as a citie builded.
      - 'And whereas she told thee, that she was barren thirtie yeares: for the which
        there were thirtie yeares, when there was not yet oblation offered in it.'
      - 'And it came to passe after thirtie yeares, Salomon built the citie, and offered
        oblations: then it was, when the barren bare a childe.'
      - And that which she sayd vnto thee, that she nourished him with labour, this
        was the habitation in Ierusalem.
      - And wheras she sayd to thee, that my sonne comming into the bryde chamber
        dyed, and that a fal chanced vnto him, this was the ruine of Ierusalem that
        is made.
      - 'And behold, thou hast seene the similitude of her: and because she lamented
        her sonne, thou beganst to comfort her: and of these thinges that haue chanced,
        these were to be opened to thee.'
      - 'And now the Highest seeth that thou wast sorie from the hart: and because
        with thy whole hart thou sufferest for her, he hath shewed thee the clearnes
        of her glorie, and the fayrenes of her beautie.'
      - For therfore did he say to thee, that thou shouldest tarie in a field where
        house is not built.
      - 'For I knew that the Highest beganne to shew thee these thinges:'
      - therfore I sayd vnto thee, that thou shouldest goe into a field, where is
        no fundation of building.
      - For the worke of mans building could not be borne in the place, where the
        citie of the Highest began to be shewed.
      - 'Thou therfore feare not, neither let thy hart dread: but goe in, and see
        the beautie, and greatnes of the building, as much as the sight of thyne eyes
        is capable to see:'
      - '& afterward thou shalt heare as much, as the hearing of thyne eares is capable
        to heare.'
      - For thou art blessed aboue manie, and art called with the Highest as few.
      - 'And to morrow night thou shalt tarie here:'
      - and the Highest wil shew thee those visions of the thinges on high, which
        the Highest wil doe to them that inhabite vpon the earth in the later dayes.
      - And I slept that night, and the other next, as he had sayd to me.
  - chapter_intro: 'An eagle appeareth to Esdras coming forth of the sea, with three

      of the wood, to suppresse the eagle.'

      - 'AND I sawe a dreame, & behold an eagle came vp out of the sea: which had
        twelue winges of fethers, and three heades.'
      - And I saw, and behold she spred her winges into al the earth, and al the windes
        of heauen blew vpon her, and were gathered together.
      - And I saw, and of her fethers sprang contrarie feathers, and they became litle
        winges, and smale.
      - For her heades were at rest, and the midle head was greater then the other
        heades, but she rested with them.
      - And I saw, and behold the eagle flew with her winges, and reigned ouer the
        earth, and ouer them that dwel in it.
      - And I saw, that al thinges vnder heauen were subiect to her, and no man gaynesayd
        her, no not one of the creature that is vpon the earth.
      - 'And I saw, and behold the eagle rose vp vpon her talons, and made a voice
        with her winges, saying:'
      - Watch not al together, sleepe euerie one in his place, & watch according to
        time.
      - But let the heades be preserued to the last.
      - And I saw, and behold the voice came not out of her heades, but from the middes
        of her bodie.
      - And I numbered her contrarie winges, and behold they were eight.
      - And I saw, and behold on the right side rose one wing, and reighned ouer al
        the earth.
      - 'And it came to passe, when it reigned, an end came to it, and the place therof
        appeared not: and the next rose vp, & reigned, that held much time.'
      - And it came to passe, when it reigned, & the end of it also came, that it
        appeared not as the former.
      - 'And behold, a voice was sent forth to it, saying:'
      - Heare thou that hast held the earth of long time. Thus I tel thee before thou
        beginne not to appeare.
      - None after thee shal hold thy time, no nor the halfe therof.
      - 'And the third lifted vp it selfe, and held the principalitie as also the
        former: and that also appeared not.'
      - And so it chanced to al the other by one & by one to haue the principalitie,
        & agayne to appeare nowhere.
      - 'And I saw, and behold in time the rest of the winges were sent vp on the
        right side, that they also might hold the principalitie: and of them there
        were that held it, but yet forthwith they appeared not.'
      - For some also of them stoode vp, but they held not the principalitie.
      - 'And I saw after these thinges, and behold the twelue winges, and two litle
        winges appeared not:'
      - and nothing remayned in the bodie of the eagle but two heades resting, and
        six litle winges.
      - And I saw, and behold from the six litle winges two were diuided, and they
        remayned vnder the head, that is on the right side. For foure taried in their
        place.
      - And I saw, and behold the vnderwinges thought to set vp them selues, and to
        hold the principalities.
      - And I saw, and behold one was set vp, but forthwith it appeared not.
      - And they that were second did sooner vanish away then the former.
      - 'And I saw, and behold the two that remayned, thought with them selues that
        they also would reigne:'
      - and when they were thincking thereon, behold one of the resting heades, which
        was the midde one awaked, for this was greater then the other two heades.
      - And I saw that the two heades were complete with themselues.
      - And behold the head with them that were with him turned, and did eate the
        two vnderwinges that thought to reigne.
      - And this head terrified al the earth, & ruled in it ouer them that inhabite
        the earth with much labour, and he that held the dominion of the whole world
        aboue al the winges that were.
      - And I saw after these thinges, and behold the midle head sodenly appeared
        not, as did the winges.
      - And there remained two heads, which reigned also themselues ouer the earth,
        and ouer them that dwelt therein.
      - And I saw, and behold the head on the right side deuoured that which was on
        the left.
      - And I heard a voice saying to me, Looke against thee, and consider what thou
        seest.
      - 'And I saw, & behold as a lion raysed out of the wood roaring: and I saw that
        he sent out a mans voyce to the eagle. And he spake saying.'
      - 'Heare thou, and I wil speake to thee, and the Highest wil say to thee:'
      - Is it not thou that hast ouercome of the foure beastes, which I made to reigne
        in my world, and that by them the end of their times might come?
      - And the fourth coming ouercame al the beastes that were past, and by might
        held the world with much feare, and al the world with most wicked laboure,
        and he inhabitied the whole earth so long time with deceipte.
      - And thou hast iudged the earth not with truth.
      - For thou hast afflicted the meeke, and hast trubled them that were quiet,
        and hast loued lyers, & hast destroyed their habitations that did fructifie,
        and hast ouerthrowen their walles that did not hurt thee.
      - And thy contumelie is ascended euen to the Highest, and thy pride to the Strong.
      - 'And the Highest hath looked vpon the proud times: and behold they are ended,
        and the abominations therof are accomplished.'
      - Therfore thou eagle appeare no more, and thy horrible winges, & thy litle
        winges most wicked, and thy heades malignant, and thy talons most wicked,
        and al thy bodie vayne,
      - that al the earth may be refreshed, and may returne deliuered from thy violence,
        and may hope for his iudgement, and mercie that made it.

        burnt, & the earth was afrayd excedingly, and I by the tumult and traunce
        of minde, and for great feare awaked, and sayd to my spirit:'

        the Highest.
      - Behold yet I am wearie in minde, and in my spirit I am very feeble, and there
        is not so much as a litle strength in me for the great feare, that I was afrayd

      - 'For thou hast counted me worthie to shew vnto me the later times. And he
        sayd to me:'
      - This is the interpretation of this vision.
      - The eagle which thou sawest coming vp from the sea, this is the kingdom which
        was sene in a vision to Daniel thy brother.<cross_ref>Dan 7:7</cross_ref>
      - But it was not interpreted to him, therfore I do now interprete it to thee.
      - Behold the dayes come, and there shal rise a kingdon vpon the earth, and the
        feare shal be more terrible then of al the kingdomes that were before it.

      - For the second shal beginne to reigne, and he shal continew more time then
        the rest of the twelue.
      - This is the interpretation of the twelue winges which thou sawest.
      - And the voice that spake which thou heardst, not coming forth of her heads,
        but from the middes of her bodie,

        no smal contentions, and it shal be in danger to fal: and it shal not fal
        then, but shal be constituted againe according to the beginning therof.'
      - And wheras thou sawest eight vnderwings cleauing to the wings therof,

        be light, and yeares swift, and two of them shal perish.
      - But when the middest time approcheth, foure shal be kept til a time, when
        the time therof shal beginne to approch to be ended, yet two shal be kept
        to the end.
      - And wheras thou sawest three heads resting,

        kingdoms, and wil cal backe manie thinges into them, and they shal rule ouer
        the earth,'
      - and them that dwel in it, with much labour aboue al them that vvere before
        them. For this cause they are called the heads of the eagle.
      - For these shal be they that shal recapitulate her impieties, and that shal
        accomplish her last thinges.
      - 'And wheras thou sawest a greater head not appearing, this is the interpretation
        therof: that one of them shal dye vpon his bed, and yet with torments.'
      - For the two that shal remayne, the sword shal eate them.
      - 'For the sword of one shal deuoure him that is with him: but yet this also
        at the last shal fal by the sword.'
      - And wheras thou sawest two vnderwings passing ouer the head that is on the
        right side,

        voice. And I answered them, and sayd:'
      - Be of good chere Israel, and be not sorowful thou house of Iacob.
      - For there is remebrance of you before the Highest, and the Strong hath not
        forgotten you in tentation.
      - 'For I haue not forsaken you, neither did I depart form you: but I came into

      a man: 5. strong against the enimies: 21. with the interpretation.'
    chapter_number: 13
    verse:
      - ~
      - AND it came to passe after seuen dayse, and I dreamed a dreame in the night.
      - And behold there rose a winde from the sea, that trubled al the waues therof.
      - 'And I saw, and behold that man grew strong with thousandes of heauen: and
        when he turned his countenance to consider, al thinges trembled that were
        sene vnder him:'
      - and whersoeuer voyce proceded out of his mouth, al that heard his voices begane
        to burne, as the earth is quiet when it feeleth the fire.
      - And I saw after these, and behold a multitude of men was gathered together,
        of whom there was no number, from the foure windes of heauen, to fight against
        the man that was come vp out of the sea.
      - And I saw, and behold he had grauen to himself a great mountaine, & he flew
        vpon it.
      - And I sought to see the countrie, or the place whence the mountaine was grauen,
        & I could not.
      - And after these thinges I saw, and behold al that were gathered to him, to
        ouerthrowe him, feared exceedingly, yet they were bold to fieght.
      - And behold as he sawe the violence of the multitude that came, he lifted not
        vp his hand, nor held sword, nor anie warlyke instrument but only as I saw,
      - that he sent forth out of his mouth as it were a blaste of fire, and from
        his lippes a spirit of flame, & from his tongue he sentforth sparkles & tempests,
        and al thinges were mingled together with this blast of fire, & spirit of
        flame, & multitude of tempests.
      - 'And it fel with violence vpon the multitude, that was prepared to fight,
        and burned them al, that suddenly there was nothing sene of an innumerable
        multitude, but only dust, & the sauour of smoke: and I saw, and was afrayd.'
      - And after these thinges I saw the man himself descending from the mountaine,
        and calling to him an other peaceable multitude,
      - 'and there came to him the countenance of manie men some reioycing, and some
        sorrowing: and some bond, some bringing of them them that were offered. And
        I was sicke for much feare, and awaked, and sayd.'
      - Thou from the beginning hast shewed thy seruant these meruelous thinges, and
        hast counted me worthie that thou wouldest receiue my petition.
      - And now shew me yet the interpretation of this dreame.
      - 'For as I thinke in my iudgement, woe to them that were leaft in those dayes:
        & much more woe to them that were not leaft.'
      - For they that were not leaft, were sorrowful.
      - I vnderstand now what thinges are layde vp in the later dayes, and they shal
        happen to them, yea and to them that are leaft.
      - For therefore they came into great dangers, and manie necessities, as these
        dreames do shew.
      - 'But yet it is easier, aduenturing to come into it, then to passe, as a cloud
        from the world, and vow to see the thinges that happen in the later time.
        And he answered me, and sayd:'
      - 'Both the interpretation of the vision I wil tel thee: and also concerning
        the thinges that thou hast spoken I wil open to thee.'
      - Wheras thou speakest of them that were leaft, this is the interpretation.
      - He that taketh away danger at that time, he hath garded himself. They that
        haue fallen into danger, these are they that haue workes, and fayth in the
        Strongest.
      - Know therefore that they are more blessed which are leaft, then they that
        are dead.
      - These are the interpretations of the vision, wheras thou sawest a man coming
        from the hart of the sea,
      - 'the same is he whom the Highest preserueth much time, which by himself shal
        deliuer his creature: and he shal dispose them that are leaft.'
      - 'And wheras thou sawest proceede out of his mouth, as it were winde, and fire,
        and tempest:'
      - 'and wheras he held no sworde, nor warlike instrument: for his violence destroyed
        the multitude that came to ouerthrow him: this is the interpretation.'
      - 'Behold the dayes come, when the Highest shal begin to deliuer them, that
        are vpon the earth:'
      - and he shal come in excesse of minde vpon them that inhabit the earth.
      - 'And one shal thinke to ouerthrow an other: one citie an other citie, one
        place an other place, and nation against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.<cross_ref>Matt
        24 / Luke 21</cross_ref>'
      - 'And it shal be, when these thinges shal come to passe, and the signes shal
        happen, which I shewed thee before: and then shal my sonne be reueled, whom
        thou sawest, as a man coming vp.'
      - 'And it shal be when al nations shal heare his voice: and euery one in his
        countrie shal leaue their warre, that they haue toward each other:'
      - and an innumerable multitude shal be gathered in one, as willing to come to
        ouerthrow him.
      - But he shal stand vpon the top of mount Sion.
      - And Sion shal come, and it shal be shewed to al prepared and builded, as thou
        sawest the mountaine to be grauen without handes.
      - And the same my sonne shal reproue the thinges that the gentils haue inuented,
        these their impieties which came nere to the tempest, because of their euil
        cogitaitons, and torments wherewith they shal begin to be tormented.
      - Which were likened to the flame, and he shal destroy them without labour by
        the law that was likened to the fyre.
      - And wheras thou sawest him gathering vnto him an other peaceable multitude.
      - 'These are the ten tribes, which were made captiue out of their land in the
        dayes of Osee the King, whom Salmanasar the King of the Assyrians led captiue:
        and he transported them beyond the riuer, and they were transported into an
        other land.<cross_ref>4 Kings 17</cross_ref>'
      - But they gaue themselues this counsel, to forsake the multitude of nations,
        and to goe forth into a farther countrie, where mankind neuer inhabited.
      - Or there to obserue their ordinances, which they had not kept in their countrie.
      - And they entred in by the narrow entrances of the riuer Euphrates.
      - For the Highest then wrought them signes, and stayed the vaines of the riuer
        til they passed.<cross_ref>Ex 14 / Jos 3</cross_ref>
      - 'For by that countie was a great way to goe, of one yeare and a half: for
        the countrie is called Arsareth.'
      - 'Then did they inhabite there til in the later time: and now againe when they
        beginne to come,'
      - 'againe the Highest shal stay the vaines of the riuer, that they may passe:
        for these thou sawest a multitiude with peace.'
      - But they also that were leaft of the people, these are they that be within
        my border.
      - 'In shal come to passe therefore, when he shal begine to destroy the multitude
        of these nations, that are gathered, he shal protect them that haue ouercome
        the people:'
      - and then shal he shew them very manie wonders.
      - 'And I sayd: Lord dominatour, shew me this, why I saw a man comming vp from
        the hart of the sea, and he sayd to me:'
      - 'As thou canst not either search these thinges, or know what thinges are in
        the depth of the sea: so can not any man vpon the earth see my sonne, or them
        that are with him, but in the time of a day.'
      - This is the interpretation of the dreame which thou sawest, and for the which
        thou only art here illuminated.
      - For thou hast leaft thyne owne law, and hast bene occupied about my law, and
        hast sought it.
      - 'For thou hast disposed thy lyfe in wisdom, and thyne vnderstanding thou hast
        called mother:'
      - and for this I haue shewed thee riches with the Highest. For it shal be after
        other three dayes, I wil speake other thinges to thee, and I wil expound to
        thee weightie and meruelous thinges.
      - And I went forth, and passed into the fielde, much glorifying & praising the
        Highest for the meruelous thinges that he did by time.
      - And because he gouerneth it, and the thinges that are brought in times, &
        I sate there three dayes.

        Esdras: and I sayd: Loe here I am Lord. And I arose vpon my feete. And he
        sayd to me:'
      - Reueling I was reueled vpon the bush, and spake to Moyses, when the people
        serued in AEgypt,<cross_ref>Ex 3</cross_ref>
      - and I sent him, and brought my people out of AEgypt, and brought him vpon
        mount Sina, & held him with me manie dayes.
      - 'And I told him manie meruelous thinges, & shewed him the secrets of times,
        and the end: and I commanded him, saying:'
      - These wordes thou shalt publish abroade, and these thou shalt hyde.
      - 'And now to thee I say:'
      - The signes which I haue shewed, and the dreames which thou hast sene, and
        the interpretations which thou hast sene, lay them vp in thy hart.
      - 'For thou shalt be receiued of al, thou shalt be conuerted the residue with
        thy counsel, and with the like to thee, til the times be finished:'
      - Because the world hath lost his youth, and the times draw nere to waxe old.
      - 'For the world is diuided by twelue partes, & the tenth part, & half of the
        tenth part are passed:'
      - and there remaineth hereafter the half of the tenth part.
      - Now therefore dispose thy house, and correct thy people, & comfort the humble
        of them, & forsake now corruption,
      - and put from thee mortal cogitations, and cast from thee humane burdens, and
        doe from thee now infirme nature, & lay at one side cogitations most trublesome
        to thee, & make speedie transmigration from these times,
      - for the euiles which thou hast sene to haue chanced now, worse then these
        wil they doe againe:<cross_ref>Matt 24 / 1 John 2</cross_ref>

        the vision which thou sawest, hasteneth to come.

        now is. But them that shal yet be born, who shal admonish?
      - The world therfore is set in darknes, and they that dwel in it without light.
      - Because thy law is burnt, therefore no man knowth the workes that haue bene
        done by thee, or that shal begin.
      - 'For if I haue found grace with thee, send the Holie Ghost to me, & I wil
        write al that hath bene done in the world from the beginning, the thinges
        that were written in thy law, that men may finde the pathe: and they that

        vpon thee,
      - thou shalt be weakned as a litle poore soule plaged and chastised of wemen,
        that the mightie and the louers may not receiue thee.
      - Wil I be zealous against thee sayth our Lord,
      - vnles thou hadst slayne myne elect at al times, exalting the slaughter of
        the handes, and saying vpon their death, when thou wast drunken.
      - Adorne the beautie of thy countenance.
      - The reward of thy fornication is in thy bosome, therefore thou shalt receiue
        recompence.
      - As thou shalt doe to my elect, sayth our Lord, so shal God do to thee, and
        shal deliuer thee vnto euil.
      - 'And thy children shal dye for famine: and thou shalt fal by the sword, and
        thy cities shal be destroyed, & al thyne shal fal in the filde by the sword.'
      - And they that are in the mountaines, shal perish, with famine, and shal eate
        their owne flesh, & drinke bloud, for the famine of bread and thirst of waters.
      - Vnhappie by the seas shalt thou come, and againe thou shalt receuie euils.
      - And in the passage they shal beate against the idle citie, and shal destroy
        some portion of thy land, and shal deface part of thy glorie, againe returning
        to Babylon ourethrowen.
      - 'And being throwen downe thou shalt be to them for stubble, and they shal
        be to thee fire:'
      - and deuoure thee, and thy cities, thy land, and thy mountaynes, al thy woodes
        and fruitful trees they wil burne with fire.
      - Thy children they shal lead captiue, & shal haue thy goodes for a praye, and
        the glorie of thy face they shal destroy.
  - chapter_intro: Al are admonished, that extreme calamities shal fal vpon this world,
      36. the penitent returning to iustice shal escape, 55. & as al thinges were
      made by Gods omnipotent powre at his wil, so al thinges shal serue to the reward
      of the blessed, and punishment of the wicked.

    verse:
      - ~
      - VVOE to thee Babylon & Asia, woe to thee AEgypt, and Syria.
      - 'Gird yourselues with sackclothes and shirtes of heare, & mourne for your
        children, & be sorie: because your destruction is at hand.'
      - The sword is sent in vpon you, and who is he that can turne it away?
      - Fire is sent in vpon you, and who is he that can quench it?
      - Euiles are sent in vpon you, and who is he that can repel them?
      - Shal anie man repel the lion being hungrie in the woode, or quench the fire
        in stubble, forthwith when it beginneth to burne?
      - Shal anie man repel the arrow shot of a strong archer?
      - Our strong Lord sendeth in euiles, and who is he that can repel them?
      - Fire came forth from his wrath, and who is he that can quench it?
      - He wil lighten, who shal not feare, he wil thunder, and who shal not be afrayed?
      - Our Lord wil threaten, and who shal not vtterly be destroyed before his face?
      - 'The earth hath trembled, and the fundations thereof, the sea tosseth vp waues
        from the depth, and the floudes of it shal be destroyed, and the fishes thereof
        at the face of our Lord, and at the glorie of his powre:'
      - because his right hand is strong which bendeth the bow, his arrowes be sharpe
        that are shot of him, they shal not misse, when they shal begine to be shot
        into the endes of the earth.
      - Behold euiles are sent, and they shal not returne til they come vpon the earth.
      - The fire is kindled and it shal not be quenched, til it consume the fundations
        of the earth.
      - For as the arrow shot of a strong archer returneth not, so shal not the euils
        returne backe, that shal be sent vpon the earth.
      - 'Woe is me, woe is me: who shal deliuer me in those dayes?'
      - The beginning of sorrowes and much mourning, the beginning of famine and much
        destruction. The beginning of warres and the potestates shal feare, the beginning
        of euiles and al shal tremble.
      - In these what shal I doe, when the euils shal come?
      - Behold famine, and plague, and tribulation, and distresse are sent al as scourges
        for amendment,
      - and in al these they wil not conuert themselues from their iniquities, neither
        wil they be alwayes mindful of the scourges.
      - Behold, there shal be good cheape victuals vpon the earth, so that they may
        thinke that peace is directly coming toward them, and then shal euiles spring
        vpon the earth, sword, famine, and great confusion.
      - For by famine manie that inhabit the earth shal dye, and the sword shal destroy
        the rest that remained aliue of the famine,
      - and the dead shal be cast forth as dung, and there shal be none to comfort
        them. For the earth shal be left desert, and the cities therof shal be throwen
        downe.
      - There shal not be left a man to til the ground and to sow it.
      - The trees shal yeeld fruites, and who shal gather them?
      - The grape shal become ripe, & who shal tread it? For there shal be great desolation
        to places.
      - For a man shal desire to see a man, or to heare his voyce.
      - For there shal be leaft ten of a citie, and two of the field that haue hid
        themselues in thicke woodes, and cliffes of rockes.
      - As there are left in the oliuet, and on euerie tree, three of foure oliues.
      - 'Or as in a vinyeard when it is gathered there are grapes left by them, that
        diligently search the vineyard:'
      - so shal there be left in those dayes three or foure, by them that search their
        houses in the sword.
      - And the earth shal be left desolate, and the fildes thereof shal waxe old,
        & the wayes thereof, and al the pathes thereof shal bringforth thornes, because
        no man shal passe by it.
      - 'Virgins shal mourne hauing no bridegromes, wemen shal mourne hauing no husbandes,
        their daughters shal mourne hauing no helpe:'
      - their bridegromes shal be consumed in battel, and their husbandes be destroyed
        in famine.
      - But heare these thinges, and know them ye seruantes of our Lord.
      - 'Behold the word of our Lord, receiue it: beleue not the goddes of whom our
        Lord speaketh.'
      - Behold the euiles approch, and slacke not.
      - As a woman with childe when shee bringeth forth her child in the ninth moneth,
        the houre of her deliuerance approching, two or three howres before, paines
        come about her wombe, and the infants coming out of her wombe, they wil not
        tarrie one moment.
      - So the euiles shal not slacke to come forth vpon the earth, and the world
        shal lament, and sorowes shal hold it round about.
      - 'Heare the word, my people: prepare yourselues vnto the fight, & in the euiles
        so be ye as strangers of the earth.'
      - He that selleth as if he should flee, and he that byeth as he that should
        lose it.
      - 'He that playeth the marchant, as he that should take no fruite: and he that
        buildeth as he that should not inhabite.'
      - 'He that soweth, as he that shal not reape: so he also that pruneth a vinyeard,
        as if he should not haue the vintage.'
      - They that marie so as if they should not get children, & they that marie not,
        so as if were widowes.
      - 'Wherfore they that labour, labour without cause:'
      - for foreners shal reape their fruites, & shal violently take their goodes,
        and ouerthrow their houses, and lead theire children captiue, because in captiuitie,
        and famine they beget their children.
      - 'And they that play the marchantes by robrie, the longer they adorne their
        cities and houses, and their possessions and persons:'
      - so much the more wil I be zealous toward them, vpon their sinnes, sayth our
        Lord.
      - 'As a whore enuieth an honest & very good woman:'
      - so shal iustice hate impietie when she adorneth herselfe, and accuseth her
        to her face, when he shal come that may defend him that searcheth out al vpon
        the earth.
      - Therefore be not made like to her, nor to her workes.
      - For yet a little whyle & iniquitie shal be taken away from the earth, & iustice
        shal reigne ouer you.
      - 'Let not the sinner say he hath not sinned: because he shal burne coales of
        fire vpon his head, that sayth I haue not sinned before our Lord God and his
        glorie.'
      - Behold our Lord shal know al the workes of men, and their inuentions, & their
        cogitations, and their hartes.<cross_ref>Eccli 23 / Luke 16</cross_ref>
      - 'For he sayd: Let the earth be made, and it was made: let the heauen be made,
        & it was made.<cross_ref>Gen 1</cross_ref>'
      - And by his worde the starrs were made, & he noweth the number of the starres.<cross_ref>Ps
        146:4</cross_ref>
      - 'Who searcheth the depth and the treasures therof: who hath measured the sea,
        & capacitie therof.<cross_ref>Job 38</cross_ref>'
      - Who hath shut vp the sea in the midest of waters, & hath hanged the earth
        vpon the waters with his word.
      - Who hath spred heauen as it were a vault, ouer the waters he hath founded
        it.
      - Who hath put fountaines of waters in the desert, and lakes vpon the toppes
        of mountaines, to send forth riuers from the high rocke to watter the earth.
      - Who made man & put his hart in the midds of the bodie, and gaue him spirit,
        life and vnderstanding.
      - And the inspiration of God omnipotent that made al thinges, and searcheth
        al hid thinges, in the secretes of the earth.
      - He knoweth your inuention, and what you thinke in your hartes sinning, and
        willing to hide your sinnes.
      - Wherfore our Lord in searching hath searched al your workes, and he wil put
        you al to open shame,
      - and you shal be confounded when your sinnes shal come forth before men, and
        the iniquities shal be they, that shal stand accusers in that day.
      - What wil you doe? or how shal you hide your sinnes before God and his Angels?
      - Behold God is the Iudge, feare him. Cease from your sinnes, and now forget
        your iniquities to doe them anie more, & God wil bring you out, and deliuer
        you from al tribulation.
      - For behold the heate of a great multitude is kindled ouer you, and they shal
        take certaine of you by violence, & shal make the slaine to be meate for idols.
      - And they that shal consent vnto them, shal be to them in derision, and in
        reproch, and in conculcation.
      - For there shal be place against places, and against the next cities great
        insurrection vpon them that feare our Lord.
      - They shal be as it were madde sparing no bodie, to spoyle and waste yet them
        that feare our Lord.
      - because they shal waste and spoyle the goodes, and shal cast them out of their
        houses.
      - Then shal appeare the probation of mine elect, as gold that is proued by the
        fire.
      - 'Heare be beloued, sayth our Lord: Behold the dayes of tribulation are come:
        and out of them I wil deliuer you.'
      - Doe not feare, nor stagger, because God is your guide.
      - 'And he that kepeth my commandmentes, and precepts, sayth our Lord God: Let
        not your sinnes ouerway you, nor your inquities be aduanced ouer you.'
      - Woe to them that are entangled with their sinnes, and are couered with their
        iniquities, as a filde is entangled with the wood, & the path therof couered
        with thornes, by which no man passeth, & it is closed out, & cast to be deuoured
        of the fire.
