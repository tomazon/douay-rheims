book_intro: 'The same vein of divine love and charity towards our neighbour, which
  runs throughout the Gospel written by the beloved disciple and Evangelist, St. John,
  is found also in his Epistles. He confirms the two principal mysteries of faith:
  The mystery of the Trinity and the mystery of the incarnation of Jesus Christ the
  Son of God. The sublimity and excellence of the evangelical doctrine he declares:
  And this commandment we have from God, that he, who loveth God, love also his brother
  (chap. 4,21). And again: For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments,
  and: His commandments are not heavy (chap. 5,3). He shews how to distinguish the
  children of God from those of the devil: marks out those who should be called Antichrists:
  describes the turpitude and gravity of sin. Finally, he shews how the sinner may
  hope for pardon. It was written, according to Baronius’ account, sixty-six years
  after our Lord’s Ascension.'

  - chapter_intro: He declares what he has seen and heard of Christ who is the life
      eternal, to the end that we may have fellowship with God and all good through
      him. Yet so if we confess our sins.

    verse:
      - ~
      - That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen
        with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled, of the
        word of life.
      - 'For the life was manifested: and we have seen and do bear witness and declare
        unto you the life eternal, which was with the Father and hath appeared to
        us.'
      - 'That which we have seen and have heard, we declare unto you: that you also
        may have fellowship with us and our fellowship may be with the Father and
        with his Son Jesus Christ.'
      - And these things we write to you, that you may rejoice and your joy may be
        full.
      - 'And this is the declaration which we have heard from him and declare unto
        you: That God is light and in him there is no darkness.'
      - If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and
        do not the truth.
      - 'But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have fellowship
        one with another: And the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from
        all sin.'
      - If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in
        us.
      - If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins and
        to cleanse us from all iniquity.
      - 'If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar: and his word is not
        in us.'
  - chapter_intro: Christ is our advocate. We must keep his commandments and love
      one another. We must not love the world nor give ear to new teachers, but abide
      by the spirit of God in the church.

            quote: A new commandment
    verse:
      - ~
      - My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. But
        if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just.
      - 'And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also
        for those of the whole world.'
      - And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his commandments.
      - 'He who saith that he knoweth him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar:
        and the truth is not in him.'
      - But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God is perfected.
        And by this we know that we are in him.
      - He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.
      - Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old commandment
        which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you
        have heard.
      - 'Again a new commandment I write unto you: which thing is true both in him
        and in you, because the darkness is passed and the true light now shineth.'
      - He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even
        until now.
      - 'He that loveth his brother abideth in the light: and there is no scandal
        in him.'
      - 'But he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and
        knoweth not whither he goeth: because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.'
      - I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for
        his name’s sake.
      - I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning.
        I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one.
      - I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father. I write unto you,
        young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and
        you have overcome the wicked one.
      - Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any man love
        the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.
      - For all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh and the concupiscence
        of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not of the Father but is of the
        world.
      - 'And the world passeth away and the concupiscence thereof: but he that doth
        the will of God abideth for ever.'
      - 'Little children, it is the last hour: and as you have heard that Antichrist
        cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists: whereby we know that it
        is the last hour.'
      - 'They went out from us but they were not of us. For if they had been of us,
        they would no doubt have remained with us: but that they may be manifest,
        that they are not all of us.'
      - But you have the unction from the Holy One and know all things.
      - 'I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to them
        that know it: and that no lie is of the truth.'
      - Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist,
        who denieth the Father and the Son.
      - Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that confesseth
        the Son hath the Father also.
      - As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning abide in you.
        If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall
        abide in the Son and in the Father.
      - And this is the promise which he hath promised us, life everlasting.
      - These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce you.
      - 'And as for you, let the unction, which you have received from him abide in
        you. And you have no need that any man teach you: but as his unction teacheth
        you of all things and is truth and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide
        in him.'
      - And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear we may have
        confidence and not be confounded by him at his coming.
      - If you know that he is just, know ye, that every one also who doth justice
        is born of him.

            quote: Committeth not sin
    verse:
      - ~
      - Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should
        be called and should be the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth not us,
        because it knew not him.
      - 'Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God: and it hath not yet appeared
        what we shall be. We know that when he shall appear we shall be like to him:
        because we shall see him as he is.'
      - And every one that hath this hope in him sanctifieth himself, as he also is
        holy.
      - Whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity. And sin is iniquity.
      - 'And you know that he appeared to take away our sins: and in him there is
        no sin.'
      - 'Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: and whosoever sinneth hath not seen
        him nor known him.'
      - Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doth justice is just, even
        as he is just.
      - 'He that committeth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from the beginning.
        For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works
        of the devil.'
      - 'Whosoever is born of God committeth not sin: for his seed abideth in him.
        And he cannot sin, because he is born of God.'
      - In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever
        is not just is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother.
      - For this is the declaration which you have heard from the beginning, that
        you should love one another.
      - 'Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one and killed his brother. And wherefore
        did he kill him? Because his own works were wicked: and his brother’s just.'
      - Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate you.
      - We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren.
        He that loveth not abideth in death.
      - Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer
        hath eternal life abiding in himself.
      - 'In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid down his life
        for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.'
      - 'He that hath the substance of this world and shall see his brother in need
        and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the charity of God abide in
        him?'
      - My little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in deed and
        in truth.
      - In this we know that we are of the truth and in his sight shall persuade our
        hearts.
      - For if our heart reprehend us, God is greater than our heart and knoweth all
        things.
      - Dearly beloved, if our heart do not reprehend us, we have confidence towards
        God.
      - 'And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him: because we keep his
        commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his sight.'
      - 'And this is his commandment: That we should believe in the name of his Son
        Jesus Christ and love one another, as he hath given commandment unto us.'
      - And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And in
        this we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he hath given us.

        instances:
          - note: 'It is hard to determine what St. John here calls a sin which is
              not to death, and a sin which is unto death. The difference can not
              be the same as betwixt sins that are called venial and mortal: for he
              says, that if a man pray for his brother, who commits a sin that is
              not to death, life shall be given him: therefore such a one had before
              lost the life of grace, and been guilty of what is commonly called a
              mortal sin. And when he speaks of a sin that is unto death, and adds
              these words, for that I say not that any man ask, it cannot be supposed
              that St. John would say this of every mortal sin, but only of some heinous
              sins, which are very seldom remitted, because such sinners very seldom
              repent. By a sin therefore which is unto death, interpreters commonly
              understand a wilfull apostasy from the faith, and from the known truth,
              when a sinner, hardened by his own ingratitude, becomes deaf to all
              admonitions, will do nothing for himself, but runs on to a final impenitence.
              Nor yet does St. John say, that such a sin is never remitted, or cannot
              be remitted, but only has these words, for that I say not that any man
              ask the remission: that is, though we must pray for all sinners whatsoever,
              yet men can not pray for such sinners with such a confidence of obtaining
              always their petitions, as St. John said before, ver. 14. Whatever exposition
              we follow on this verse, our faith teacheth us from the holy scriptures,
              that God desires not the death of any sinner, but that he be converted
              and live, Ezech. 33.11. Though men’s sins be as red as scarlet, they
              shall become as white as snow, Isa. 3.18. It is the will of God that
              every one come to the knowledge of the truth, and be saved. There is
              no sin so great but which God is willing to forgive, and has left a
              power in his church to remit the most enormous sins: so that no sinner
              need despair of pardon, nor will any sinner perish, but by his own fault.'

              sin; which is the only sin that never can be remitted. But, it is probable,
              he may also comprise under this name, the sin of apostasy from the faith,
              and some other such heinous sins as are seldom and hardly remitted:
              and therefore he gives little encouragement, to such as pray for these
              sinners, to expect what they ask.'

          - note: As the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, all bear witness to
              Christ’s divinity; so the spirit, which he yielded up, crying out with
              a loud voice upon the cross; and the water and blood that issued from
              his side, bear witness to his humanity, and are one; that is, all agree
              in one testimony.
            quote: The spirit, and the water, and the blood
    verse:
      - ~
      - Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. And every one
        that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him.
      - 'In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep
        his commandments.'
      - 'For this is the charity of God: That we keep his commandments. And his commandments
        are not heavy.'
      - 'For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. And this is the victory
        which overcometh the world: Our faith.'
      - Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the
        Son of God?
      - 'This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only
        but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth that Christ
        is the truth.'
      - And there are Three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and
        the Holy Ghost. And these three are one.
      - 'And there are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit and the water
        and the blood. And these three are one.'
      - If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this
        is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his
        Son.
      - 'He that believeth in the Son of God hath the testimony of God in himself.
        He that believeth not the Son maketh him a liar: because he believeth not
        in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son.'
      - And this is the testimony that God hath given to us eternal life. And this
        life is in his Son.
      - He that hath the Son hath life. He that hath not the Son hath not life.
      - 'These things I write to you that you may know that you have eternal life:
        you who believe in the name of the Son of God.'
      - 'And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we
        shall ask according to his will, he heareth us.'
      - 'And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the
        petitions which we request of him.'
      - 'He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him ask:
        and life shall be given to him who sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto
        death. For that I say not that any man ask.'
      - All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death.
      - 'We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not: but the generation of
        God preserveth him and the wicked one toucheth him not.'
      - We know that we are of God and the whole world is seated in wickedness.
      - And we know that the Son of God is come. And he hath given us understanding
        that we may know the true God and may be in his true Son. This is the true
        God and life eternal.
      - Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
