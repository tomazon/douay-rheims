# douey-rheims
The Douey Rheims Challoner Bible with markup that allows for multiple styles of formatting.

# Why

I can sit comfortably while reading my 1941 Douay-Rheims Bible
or while reading my reprint[^1] of a 1909 Clemintine Vulgate in latin.

As I try to improve my latin, I find it unweildy to side with both open on my lap.
Baronius Press[^2] publishes a marvilious parallel bible.

But I'm looking for something more portable.

A parallel latin english bible that I can read while lounging in a comfortable a chair.
One that I can easily take with me as I go to the park, library, or coffee shop.
A parallel bible with Challoner's notes that I can keep in my bag and pull out when I find a free moment.

Inspired to create a English/Latin parallel bible where:
  * A pamphlet with a single book of the bible (i.e just The book of Genesis) to make it easy to keep with me as I'm out and about
  * 2 columns per page, latin on the inside, english on the outside
  * Challoner intro to the book of the bible
  * Challoner intro to each chapter
  * Challoner footnotes
  * feels reverent and classic (to me - very mush a personal preference):
    * A classic typeface (EB Garamond or Minister)
    * Dropcaps (maybe Lombardic or Lasance Initials [^3], but EB Garamond is still great)
    * Printed on a tan/cream paper

## Extra

I learn a lot and keep inline with the Catholic teaching by reading the Haydock 
commentary using a reprint[^4] of a Haydock Douay-Rheims Bible.
At 8&half;x 11 inches and 5&frac23; pounds (about 22 x 28 cm and 89&frac23; kilograms)
and with a tiny typeface.  It's impractical to take it with me.

If I can find a clean and copyright free copy of Haydock's comentary, 
I'd like to print Haydocks commentary:
  * 1 pamphlet for a single book of the bible (i.e. just The Gospel of Luke)
  * Only Haydock's commentary for the book and each chapter (not the bible text itself)


## Potential options for creators of bibles to make

But why generate a text for a single use?

There are many options for the publisher of a bible to make:

* media:
  * Paper book
  * Web page
  * eBook (epub3, mobi, etc)
* number of columns per page
* verse layout
  * verse-by-verve
  * paragraph
* verse numbers
  * none
  * in column
  * in paragraph
* beginning of a chapter section
  * "Chapter #"
  * "Chapter # of the Book of ___"
  * "Challoner's introduuction"
  * Chapter number as a dropcap
* beginning of a chapter paragraph
  * just-a-linebreak
  * drop-cap of the chapter number
  * drop-cap of first letter
    * same typeface as text
    * different tyeface (EB Garamond / Lombardic / Lasance Initials / etc)
    * image (wood cut)
* parallel latin
  * 2 column:
    * latin in left column
    * latin in right column
    * latin in inner column (page spread)
    * latin in outer column (page spread)
  * facing page
    * Tvvedale's line breaks, paragraph, & "verse" markup (for psalter)
    * Grail line breaks, & paragraphs
* marking within text of where there is a footnote:
  * underline text
  * superscript letter at end
  * hyperlink (ebooks/webpages)
* Christ's words:
  * in red
  * other markup
* Bold and/or small-caps "THE LORD"

    * The reason for the desision with citations to authorative sources must be preserved
  * Changes to markup/format (linebreak/paragraph marking, etc) that are trivilaly removed by a computer program
      * are not considered to be protected biblical text.
      * Do NOT need to be traceable to a source with an Imprimatur.
      * Do NOT need to be documents as to reason for decision.
  * The format should be
    * Well documented
    * Easily parsable by a computer program
